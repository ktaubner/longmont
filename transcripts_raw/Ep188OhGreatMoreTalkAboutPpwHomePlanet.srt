1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
come back and make a bet

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,120
and we see a black

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,840
you've been crap monster

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,080
the

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,920
the well we started i press start on the record is a lot of work in clock

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,640
it is a sixty two hundred six thousand two hundred okay so that's how the

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Okay, four. Okay, great. I was beeping every time.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Why did I do that? Yeah!

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Alright, now we're counting up. Alright, that makes sense. Yeah. That's pretty good.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,640
Counting up is better than counting down. Yeah, I agree.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,640
We got a clock so we can know when the episode should stop.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,640
Does that make you feel pressured though? Does that not?

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Definitely. If it's counting up, it doesn't. If it was counting down, it definitely would.

14
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,900
I think it's if he makes me feel pressure because it's red yeah, a red number

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,680
it's very intimidating directly across from me like yeah, it's like I have a

16
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,320
right number right here, too. I have two numbers to look at now that's too many

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,560
bread is this one around not for me. Yeah, it is red check it out. There's a

18
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,000
red circle next to it too. That's probably the scariest red shape. Big

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
trouble does this beep once it hits the time again. We'll see it probably

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,760
the episode will and I just like I could be every minute is would be very funny

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,660
if it reaches an hour to make some really loud beep

22
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,360
and we just end it immediately.

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,200
No matter what we're doing.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,620
- I think that's what we do.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,460
I think that's what we do.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,300
- Oh, that's interesting.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,660
- Whenever the beep goes off,

28
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,860
the episode's ended. - Oh, I actually have to go.

29
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,700
- Yeah.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,540
- You should hook up the whole,

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,540
we should hook up all the electricity in the office

32
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,380
to the clock.

33
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:34,200
(laughing)

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,740
And set it for like nine hours every day.

35
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,580
- And the sprinklers turn on.

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,460
- And so we don't overwork ourselves.

37
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,460
- It locks the door, you get locked in.

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,300
(laughing)

39
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,740
You're not out by the time it ends.

40
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,820
- Can you guys believe we're one month into the office?

41
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,660
- Yeah.

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,480
- It's crazy.

43
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:56,960
I mean either me either we have seven keys yeah yeah what are they gonna change

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,480
the locks don't think so crazy they probably forgot we're down here we're so

45
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,600
quiet no way no way no how they forgot we're down here that lady has my phone

46
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,320
number now she called me at 2 in the morning oh yes she did then she's a

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,480
scholar 2 in the morning I think to confirm that it was my phone number but I

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
I also think...

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
I don't think that's why she got it.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
She told me she put two sevens at the last two digits on my show.

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
She had like a... how many numbers are usually in a phone number?

52
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,480
Nine.

53
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,480
No. Ten.

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,480
Nine.

55
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,480
So she added... so she had a phone number for me that was like 13 numbers.

56
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,480
And was like... she couldn't get...

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Well that's your extension.

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,480
She couldn't get rid of the other two numbers because she was wearing mittens.

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,240
yes i don't know what you do with the flip phone

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,880
can get rid of the other two numbers

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,140
and uh... at two in the morning

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,360
i don't know she called me it to me because you're doing the men's team

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,600
one of those

64
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,760
she wanted you

65
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,600
and she's usually come over how about their

66
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,400
needs to hear it

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,200
maybe

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
on their matter

69
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
we have a whole plot with us today

70
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
joanne alexander okay

71
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,400
uh...

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,020
you know it was a real bird

73
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,420
sorry to upset you

74
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,020
that was a little more importantly than home planet

75
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,340
patrick is trying a new monster you know

76
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,220
and i found this at the dollar tree and not only that the unscathed he uncovered

77
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,740
oh yeah i don't know if there is a mystery monster mystery has been a

78
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,080
did you guys did you tell you guys about i have anything about that so i was

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,300
sitting here i was sitting here i was looking at this can this is a

80
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,740
is a monster lewis hamilton who i learned from the can risk is a formula

81
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,820
one driver yeah I don't do that I don't know sort of the LeBron James of

82
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:46,420
Formula One so he's LeBron James of driving a car in a straight line so fast

83
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:54,860
yeah so like yeah he's more of like a show for the reptilian invader was China

84
00:03:54,860 --> 00:04:03,380
I believe yeah yeah China Chinatown he's doing he's doing sharp turns though yeah

85
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,380
I don't know what Formula One is.

86
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,380
But anyway, it's the first Formula.

87
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,380
I can break it down.

88
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
It's a scientific term.

89
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Is Formula One the long skinny cars?

90
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,380
With big wheels.

91
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,380
That's like Monaco.

92
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
That's an Ironman 2.

93
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,380
Formula One, is that the one where the car looks like a shark?

94
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,380
Or is that Hot Wheels?

95
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
Is it the one where the car goes in a giant loop?

96
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
All the way up and down like Sonic?

97
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,380
Is that the one where Bowser is driving one of them?

98
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,380
No.

99
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,120
No, is that the one where you sometimes like some of the tracks you fly out of a

100
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,080
shark's mouth or like a yeah, yeah, yeah, is that is that the one is that the

101
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,400
one Mario drives them or crash bandicoot dress them is it's more of like a human

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,300
being thing, but it's a Mario and their heads and their heads are just like a

103
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,500
normal heads or what size their heads are really big or I would say their heads

104
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,440
are probably small. If we're looking at the crash bandicoot, that's the one with

105
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,940
sweet tooth, the clown unfamiliar with sweet to really is it he could be. I

106
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
- I don't know it well enough.

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,200
- Super Bombad F1.

108
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
- Is it what?

109
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,560
- Super Bombad F1.

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,080
- Yeah, are there Gungans involved?

111
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,920
- Yeah.

112
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,760
- Do the cars travel?

113
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
- I'm pretty much like, I know Lewis Hamilton

114
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,640
and then like everyone else I don't really know.

115
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,120
- Is that where the carts like bump into each other

116
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,600
and they have the big pole that hits the ceiling?

117
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
- I think they do bump into each other.

118
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,360
I don't know about the poles.

119
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,840
- Is that the one where it's like a boat

120
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,680
and it's Leonardo DiCaprio's on the boat and he dies?

121
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,280
- That one's good, I've seen that one.

122
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,040
I've played that one before.

123
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,240
That's my favorite one to play.

124
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,600
- I love playing that one.

125
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,920
Is that the one with John Lovitz and Mr. Bean and they're like trying to get the money at

126
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
the end of the movie?

127
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,120
Oh, you know, Vince Vallu is in that too.

128
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
Vince Vallu.

129
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
And Whoopi Goldberg.

130
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
And Whoopi, yeah.

131
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
I mean, dude, I'm not trying to...

132
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
It could be any of this.

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Is that the one with Louis Hamilton?

134
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,640
I only know Louis Hamilton and I know one other guy.

135
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:49,400
So you're sure it's not the one with Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland and

136
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,200
they team up to fight the ultimate villains?

137
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,640
Okay, okay, we all know that one.

138
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
I think they probably show up at some point, but...

139
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,920
Is that... have you drank in any of it?

140
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,560
Yeah, I drank half the can already.

141
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,720
What taste would you flavor it as?

142
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,840
- Okay, so I, so--

143
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,680
- Car.

144
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
(laughing)

145
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,240
- Car, this tastes like jet, this tastes like oil.

146
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,440
But I was sitting here and then I saw

147
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,080
that there was a label underneath the,

148
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,280
there was like a plastic wrapped label,

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,160
so I took a pair of scissors and I cut the can open.

150
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,400
And this is all in German.

151
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,360
- And the label on top was in English.

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,460
- The label on top was in English

153
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,800
and it said copyright 2021.

154
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,760
So they either had old cans--

155
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
- Yeah, what's the copyright on the German one?

156
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
- The German one?

157
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,320
- 1939.

158
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,560
(laughing)

159
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,480
- It got sent over in operation paper.

160
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,140
- The German one is,

161
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,840
- They wouldn't have it.

162
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
- 2017.

163
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,500
- Really?

164
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,340
- Whoa.

165
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,180
- So this is a vintage.

166
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,440
- Can I see it?

167
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,560
- So they are ripping you off.

168
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,240
- You should go demand your dollar back.

169
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,880
- It was only a dollar 25.

170
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,440
- But you're putting it in your body,

171
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,600
even though you just said it's from 2017.

172
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,560
- No, it's 'cause it's a vintage.

173
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,200
taste. I also have monster juiced ripper up there. Can you believe he just drank that?

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,260
I can't believe, I can't fathom drinking monster energy in general. It's pretty good. You should

175
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,440
grow up. Ugh. It does smell like gas, like it's like incredibly potent. Give it back,

176
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,400
you don't respect it. Wait, I just wanna. You're gonna put a dent in the can. When your

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,960
four time F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton, life moves at 15,000 RPM and 200 miles per

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,960
- Sounds like a nightmare.

179
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,700
(laughing)

180
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,840
- Sounds like hell, bro.

181
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,700
- I don't want to do that.

182
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
- Is it date itself?

183
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
- Kill me!

184
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,040
- 15,000 times per minute.

185
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,500
(screaming)

186
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
- Does it date itself on the can at all?

187
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
- He's probably won more than four times.

188
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,840
- Drank by President George Bush.

189
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
- I have the new label.

190
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,840
- A man who exists.

191
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
- So they could have just had old cans

192
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,840
and then just printed new labels on them.

193
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,220
- I think that's clearly what happened.

194
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220
- Light, crisp, and refreshing with a fast finish.

195
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,880
- It gets you out front and pulling away.

196
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,160
- Damn, that sounds sexy.

197
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,000
- Yeah, I'm out front.

198
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,320
- It's got like a texture to it too.

199
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,160
It's got me pulling away.

200
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,280
- Yeah, see, they put the fucking,

201
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,880
the best thing about every monster can is the texture,

202
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
and they put that label on it.

203
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,440
- That's the best thing about monster cans?

204
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,280
- That's why I get it.

205
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
- It's how tactile it is.

206
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
- It's like ribbed.

207
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,400
- Yeah, it's got grip.

208
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
- Whoa, it does, yeah.

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
- Yeah.

210
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,160
- That's the best thing about every monster can.

211
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,000
- This'll never slip out of your hand.

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,840
- Is the grip?

213
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,400
- Yeah, the grip is the best thing about monster cans.

214
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,280
- Are they all gripped?

215
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,700
- Yeah, they are gripped.

216
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,700
When did that happen?

217
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,260
All the zeros and stuff.

218
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
Yeah.

219
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
All the monster zero?

220
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
But not the normal one.

221
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
What's a grain?

222
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Monster juice is not a grip.

223
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Monster zero, you're so thin that you don't even have those.

224
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Monster juice is not, does not have a grip.

225
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Is monster juice normal?

226
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
The monster zero has a grip.

227
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
What's monster juice?

228
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,380
Because that's when they take the sugar out, they put it on the outside of the can.

229
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,380
Yeah.

230
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,380
And that's like the grain.

231
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Crystallizes, yeah.

232
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,020
But what is monster juice?

233
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Monster juice is...

234
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,500
You don't want to know.

235
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Monster juice.

236
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Monster juice.

237
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Have you ever had the tea, the rehab?

238
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Monster juice.

239
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,180
the black they change it to monster recover it's no longer monster rehab

240
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:59,940
that's monsters pretty good you can't even call it drink rehab anymore

241
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:07,580
PCS JWS yeah even though it was a rehab thanks so thanks Obama thanks a lot

242
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,500
Obama yes shallow Obama this blue-haired Obama

243
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,620
God this blue hair asymmetrical hair

244
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,820
coat Obama's right.

245
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,820
He got blue hair.

246
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
Yeah.

247
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,820
It's the news tomorrow Obama got blue hair.

248
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,100
How angry like.

249
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,300
I did it for Marge Simpson.

250
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,220
I wanted to be Marge for Halloween.

251
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,420
I love Marge Simpson.

252
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,420
Marge Simpson.

253
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,740
She's the mom of fellow Americans.

254
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,900
On the Simpsons.

255
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,060
It's like on 60 Minutes.

256
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,220
So he's like why did you choose?

257
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:48,940
President Obama, what drove you there? He could rock a cool March hair cut. I think

258
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:57,980
if Obama dressed up as Marge that would probably trigger a successful January 6th. I think

259
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,620
the government would end. He's not even there but people would be so mad. Just seeing that

260
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,620
on Twitter or something. I would have gotten a call from my grandpa and he'd be in a Mad

261
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:13,420
max convoy headed to the fucking capital. He's got like a red leather jacket. Yeah. And he's

262
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,180
like yep Caleb this is what I'm doing now. We're going up Barack Obama. I'm FaceTiming

263
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,140
you because it's the last time I'm gonna see you. They're just going up there they don't

264
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,500
want to hurt him they just want to look at him and drool because he looks so hot as Marge.

265
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,940
I feel like politically it might be a smart move though. To marge it up. Just throw a curveball

266
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:33,940
like. Well yeah like hey. Like why did he do that? Yeah try to get Tucker Carlson to

267
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,860
make some excuse why this is a bad thing.

268
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,860
It seems like all he did was grow his hair long.

269
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,060
Tucker's ratings after Marge Obama...

270
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
They'd be crazy.

271
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,060
They'd be, "Hey, excellent."

272
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
It seems like...

273
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Obama wants to turn his hair blue.

274
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
Why?

275
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
It seems like Obama is spending more time dying his hair

276
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
than he is even playing golf these days.

277
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
[laughter]

278
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,060
He's trying to become

279
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Marge Simpson. Why?

280
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,460
because liberals are stuck in a fantasy land like a cartoon. They're trying to become cartoons.

281
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,180
What's next? He's gonna turn his skin yellow, maybe. Like Marge.

282
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
What's next? Bo Obama. Santa's little helper.

283
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,180
[laughter]

284
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,180
Kinda.

285
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,180
Dude, that'd be so crazy. Tucker getting mad at Marge Obama.

286
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Yeah, that'd probably change the world for everyone.

287
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
You know who they would have on to talk about that?

288
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,180
You know the Obamas are a little bit The Simpsons though.

289
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,180
Mike Huckabee.

290
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:39,820
questions though. Yeah. They have a mom, dad, dog, Bart, Lisa, Maggie. They're funny as

291
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:51,020
hell. Yeah. You know how Obama's always going like. He drinks Dove beer. What's he in charge

292
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,980
of? Nuclear bullshit at one point. What's he love? TV? He loves watching TV. And he's

293
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:05,380
It kind of makes perfect sense. Biden is Katie's friend with Krusty. Who's Biden in the Simpsons?

294
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:10,660
Milhouse. Biden's Milhouse. Or Milhouse's dad. Huh? Milhouse's dad. No, because who's, no

295
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,980
Biden's like. No, I think Hunter Biden is Milhouse and then Kirk Van Houten is Joe Biden.

296
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,620
Who's um. Or maybe it's the other way around. Oh, Biden has a dead, Biden's Flanders. True.

297
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,120
Oh, there we go. There we go. Dead wife, two sons. Obama and Biden were always like

298
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,460
grrr. Yeah, they hated each other. You know why? Because Obama hated Joe Biden.

299
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,820
Biden was such a nerd. Yeah. The way that like liberal couples are nowadays,

300
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,040
it's kind of like Obama would be Marge and Michelle Obama would be Homer.

301
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,340
Yep, that's probably true. Probably. I thought that was under the assumption.

302
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,060
That's what it was. That's what it definitely is. Yeah. Michelle Obama, I

303
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,260
mean, she's got Homer's arms. Remember that? Everybody was like, her arms are

304
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,960
muscular yeah I do remember yeah remember she took all the good snacks out

305
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,400
of school I'm gonna talk about this again it was fucked up miss school lunch I

306
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,640

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,520
I'm not the first time okay we also have our first time we both had caviar at the

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:33,160

you basically you fell for caviar yeah like really easily it's like it's like

315
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,560
- Yeah, literally, yeah.

- Really, really rich people.

318
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,960
- And I fell hard.

319
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,880
- Really, really rich people invented caviar

320
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
to prank normal rich people and be like,

321
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
oh no, yeah, that's super good and cool to eat.

322
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,560
- Yeah.

323
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,400
- It's the same, it's the dude.

324
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,280
- I'm saying purely based off taste, it's like a fun thing.

325
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,440
- I mean, what was the human mouth feel?

326
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,760
- That's the same thing with lobster.

327
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,000
Lobster's a bug.

328
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,840
- Lobster is good.

329
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,680
- I mean, it's good, but you're falling for it.

330
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,960
- You're betraying New England by it.

331
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,800
- No, I like lobster, but you have to admit,

332
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,840
it's a bug that lives on the bottom of the ocean.

333
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,240
- Chicken's just a bird.

334
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,480

The only meal I have won't do hundreds of dollars of pastry.

344
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,440
Yeah, your meal prep days insane.

345
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
Yeah, just rolling everything you donkey.

346
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,940
I'm yelling at myself.

347
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,840
I think good.

348
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,240
Oh fucking shit.

349
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,840
Fuck me.

350
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,040
You've done fuck me.

351
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,740
This isn't love.

352
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,240
- Oh, fuck me. - It's a caterpillar.

353
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,100
(laughing)

354
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
- Did you think I wouldn't tell the difference?

355
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,740
- Oh, fuck me, mate.

356
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,420
They sold, look at this.

357
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,020
They sold me a bunch of chrysalises.

358
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,220
- The caterpillars have too many legs.

359
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,460
- Would you guys--

360
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,060
- These are centipedes, fuck.

361
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,900
- Fuck me. - Are you guys gonna eat

362
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,180
all the bugs?

363
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,700
All the different bugs that we're gonna have

364
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,660
to eat pretty soon?

365
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,480
- Yeah.

366
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,320
- We're gonna have to eat a lot of bugs.

367
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,160
- Cicadas. - Yeah.

368
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,380
- Just 'cause like protein stuff?

369
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,220
- Yeah.

370
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,860
- What are you talking about? - We're running out of chicken.

371
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,900
No. Joe Biden just said, "I just got a Google alert because I have a Google alert for chicken."

372
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,540
Joe Biden just said we're running out of chicken. He did an entire press conference just to say we're

373
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:58,860
running out of chicken. You know what else? People are freaking out about us running out

374
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:03,660
of chicken. Everyone forgets. He also said two sentences later, "And we're running out of sauce,

375
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,740
too." No. Not sauce. We're running out of chicken and sauce. You have a Google alert for chicken,

376
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,680
Joe from surf's up. Yeah, chicken Joe sauce. Have you guys ever eaten?

377
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,140
Someday they're gonna make it bro. Google it for like hamburger.

378
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,580
I want to know. Yeah. I mean,

379
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,660
sending that and immediately getting like 10 million emails.

380
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:34,180
Perfect. I got a reading list. You turn it on in your phone. Just explode.

381
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,980
Have you guys ever eaten one of those spicy crickets or something?

382
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Yeah.

383
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
I ate a ranch cricket.

384
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,660
I think I ate a chocolate cricket one time.

385
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,180
I feel like that one is probably the easiest.

386
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,700
I've eaten like eight spiders in my sleep every year though.

387
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Eight spiders?

388
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,700
As a rule?

389
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,700
Yeah.

390
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Yeah.

391
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,820
On average or eight?

392
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
On average.

393
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
Some years it will be five.

394
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,740
Some years it will be eleven.

395
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,500
I wonder if those are the better years when you eat more spiders.

396
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,500
Definitely.

397
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,500
You take their energy.

398
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,420
Yeah, it's protein that you don't know you have.

399
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:13,740
What if, well it's on average, so what if you live like a hundred years but you eat 800 spiders

400
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,740
in one year?

401
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
I mean, I think, yeah.

402
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
You just get it out of the way.

403
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
As a newborn, you're just like, I can't do it.

404
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Well, you would have averaged, you would have made it eight.

405
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
You do that to like, as many spiders as possible.

406
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
You just do that to your baby, like your parent.

407
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Yeah.

408
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Because then you just, first year, spider gumbo for my kids.

409
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
It makes the rest of his life so easy.

410
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
Yeah, you know, and the spiders do this, and then the spiders just learn that it's a good

411
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,740
thing.

412
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
And then you just do it like, you know, you're like, I'm going to do it like, I'm going to

413
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,580
- Crawling out of his body every day.

414
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,940
- You just do that to your baby, like your parent.

415
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,780
- Yeah.

416
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,980
- 'Cause then you just first year.

417
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
- It makes the rest of his life so easy.

418
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,820
- Yeah, you know?

419
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,660
- And the spiders do this,

420
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,980
and then the spiders just learn

421
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,100
that it's a good mouth to go into.

422
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,260
- And then see all the others.

423
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,380
- But yeah, it's just 100 spiders a night, forever.

424
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
- When the kid is like 12,

425
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,700
he's just like at school vomiting up like a termite.

426
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,900
- The thing about eating spiders

427
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,060
is it may be like a little bit of extra protein,

428
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:55,980
but I also think if you eat an entire animal whole,

429
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,180
you get it's like life force and so yeah you get it.

430
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,680
I agree.

431
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,480
This is like that's the difference with the heads on them.

432
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I don't like I've had it.

433
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,080
I've been thinking about this every day since you had the head of the

434
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:05,380
shrimp.

435
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,980
Well, no, it's a place that serves head to place and they serve head

436
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,580
on shrimp, which is my my guess.

437
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:09,980
So good.

438
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,980
The eyeballs like explode in your mouth so bad.

439
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,380
They taste really good to you want something to explode.

440
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
Do you eat the do you eat the poop line too?

441
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,780
I think they probably devane it or whatever.

442
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,780
Well, if they don't take off the head, why would they take one off?

443
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,580
- Well, also shrimp poop is not poop.

444
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,420
Like it's like-- - Yeah, yeah, it's true.

445
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,260
- It's all dirt. - It's all shrimp poop.

446
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,960
- Yeah, dog poop isn't human poop either.

447
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,800
I'll eat that.

448
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
- No, but dogs are eating meat.

449
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Shrimp are just absorbing-- - Dirt.

450
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,000
- Particles that fly through.

451
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,840
- It's still-- - It's still poop.

452
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,800
- Particles is a lot different from food.

453
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,040
(laughing)

454
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,720
- Like, I'd let a shrimp like poop in my mouth.

455
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,200
(laughing)

456
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,680
'Cause it's not the same-- - Why?

457
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,280
Why would you let-- - I'm saying--

458
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,400
- Like for free? - You don't have to.

459
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
You can just not.

460
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,520
- If I had a choice between doing it and not doing it,

461
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,360
I would let it do it.

462
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,420
- You have a shrimp poop in your mouth.

463
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,260
- Well what is it?

464
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,100
- For what reason?

465
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
You're choosing to eat poop.

466
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,100
- I'm just saying I would do that

467
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,140
over any other animal's poop.

468
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,060
- Yeah, good point.

469
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,720
You have to pick one animal.

470
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,180
- If you have to pick one animal,

471
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,060
at gunpoint, it's your life or you eat this animal's poop.

472
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,380
- That's not what you said though.

473
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,460
You just said, "I would eat this animal's poop."

474
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,740
- No, I know, but I'm saying that I don't care.

475
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,380
What I should say is I don't care if I eat a shrimp's poop.

476
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,420
- You don't care about eating poop.

477
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,500
I don't either. I've eaten a shrimp before. I would like to not eat poop.

478
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,180
Any poop that's brown or white. I'm against brown or what about green bird

479
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,700
poop. Green counts as a subsect of brown. I think usually that you're

480
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,380
that's not the size of the car. But in poop, if you see a green poop, it's

481
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:43,740
yeah, that's in the goods in the normal mammal poop family. Okay, so if you

482
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,060
it's okay, so okay, so if you saw an animal and it pooped just like it poop

483
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,260
like diarrhea, the folds of diarrhea, it looks like you're like you're folding

484
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,460
over his chocolate. - What is it, gelato?

485
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,740
- Yeah, and it's red.

486
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,020
You're eating that? (laughing)

487
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,860
- No, no, no, so I mean--

488
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,340
- You're not saying he's just gonna go eat it,

489
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,420
no matter what he eats. - You said anything

490
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,980
but brown or white.

491
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,860
- He can't stop himself, I mean it's hard,

492
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,980
but he can stop himself from eating shit.

493
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,400
- Hold it back!

494
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,140
- I would eat like a sea creature's poop,

495
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,900
if he's probably not. (laughing)

496
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,940
- Yeah. - That's probably

497
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,140
not that bad. - Would you eat the green stuff

498
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,260
in a lobster? - No, no, no, no, no.

499
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,700
- Would you rather be like-- - No, because they're--

500
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,380
- No, they're like sharks will poop and it's like--

501
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,140
What they're eating is like moldy barn, that's like a cloud of like, that's a cloud of other

502
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,460
animals poop that they're eating.

503
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,620
That's like a gross, that's a, like, that's a, it's poop, that's not what this scene is.

504
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,340
I would eat a fly's poop if I had to eat one single poop.

505
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
A fly?

506
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,340
A fly.

507
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Yeah, but that's real poop, bro, you're crazy, bro.

508
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,740
No, I bet I wouldn't even, I bet I wouldn't even notice it.

509
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,340
Would you rather eat a fly's poop or like see your mom naked?

510
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,340
See my mom naked?

511
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
Really?

512
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
Dude, yeah, she's hot.

513
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:49,340
I do fly poop every day.

514
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
No, I would...

515
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Every fucking day, dude.

516
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,340
Every fucking day.

517
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,340
I just eat the fly poop every day.

518
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,340
You need like a fish oil supplement.

519
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:00,300
Well, you need to do it every day to stave off seeing your mom.

520
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,300
If you skip even one day...

521
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,300
Nope, not today, mom.

522
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Sorry.

523
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Come on.

524
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,300
You're squeezing the fly.

525
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Come on.

526
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
Please, please.

527
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
Come on.

528
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,300
You paper duck.

529
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
Well...

530
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Oh, fuck.

531
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,860
Dude, you hear the shower turn off.

532
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Oh my God.

533
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
I gotta do it.

534
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:19,940
don't think flies poop. I'm sure flies poop. Where does it go then? They spit out stuff

535
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:26,020
that dissolves their food and then they suck it up. Yeah, but no, but poop, they still

536
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,100
have to get nutrients, right? But where do they poop? I've never seen a fly poop. I'm

537
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,620
guessing at a time. Can we google fly poop microstoop? Yes, I have. When they rub their

538
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,740
hands that's them spitting out gunk. Have you seen, were you here when I looked up flies

539
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,420
having sex have you seen that no so funny it's just like I looked up superfly

540
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,660
having said here's a picture of fruit fly poop fruit fly excrement on food

541
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,640
contains pheromones that entice other flies to join that looks like a berry so

542
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,220
they eat their own eat that they poop over they poop on I thought that was

543
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,620
fruit fly poop under a magnifying so fruit flies poop on something and all the

544
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,900
other fruit flies smell the poop and are like that means that's good if you I'm

545
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,940
I'm gonna go see that if you eat fruit you're eating fly poop

546
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,180
No, if I fly poop you can wash it if you eat fruit from like a bodega

547
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:18,180
That's why you don't eat the fruit before you were you you're getting an apple on the way to like

548
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm not gonna get sick from it. So yeah, there's a mental thing of like, oh, yeah, this is gross. This had dirt on it

549
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,700
I'm on my body. I feel like sick from so much dirt in my life. Yeah, I feel like bacteria

550
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,740
there's a lot of people right there now housefly poop you to the point most dirt

551
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,340
is pretty clean

552
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:40,700
yes in quotes let's see if it is here

553
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:46,060
also sitting it's sitting i feel like you know very well all along

554
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,140
i feel like a little

555
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,300
all along i don't know what the public's alive it's really good you eat that

556
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
all

557
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,220
okay

558
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,020
all that way really that is that is not a whole shoots out of the cool and then

559
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,340
and he drops a smudge bomb. So you would

560
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:06,140
that's called do it. Yeah, it's just like super super. I guess I suppose

561
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,020
not huge.

562
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,260
It's like the size of a card. Yeah, it's the biggest poop we've ever seen

563
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,020
in a bad scenario to eat a fly. Yeah, why not?

564
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:21,020
So you'd eat you'd eat fly you'd eat flyer shrimp poop. No problem, but it

565
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:23,220
would take a bad situation to eat a fly.

566
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,740
No, no, I'd eat it take a bad situation to eat

567
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,800
if prepared nicely at a restaurant, I don't care.

568
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,640
- A fly?

569
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
(laughing)

570
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,560
- Yeah.

571
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,680
- Yeah, if it was like in his soup,

572
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,280
if it was in his soup, he'd eat it.

573
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,880
- It's the same thing with a spider.

574
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,520
- Spending like $25 at like a bistro to get a fly.

575
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,720
- If you took a tarantula and you like grilled it

576
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,120
and seasoned it and stuff like that,

577
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,000
I would probably enjoy it.

578
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,720
- I think that like any, I feel like most--

579
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,120
- Spider on nachos.

580
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,960
(laughing)

581
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,780
I would love that.

582
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,280
- Most animals, if it's like prepared and like,

583
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,120
it's not like poison, I would probably eat it

584
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
if it got put in front of me.

585
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,960
- I don't know what the head on shrimp is.

586
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,420
It's really fucking good.

587
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,920
- I did not find it very good.

588
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,140
- You gotta take me to this place, I gotta eat it.

589
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,520
- The shell is too thick and it feels like

590
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,600
you're eating a coin.

591
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,440
- What?

592
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,260
- Yeah.

593
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,100
- That's where they got the head on shrimp?

594
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,940
- Yeah.

595
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,060
- Fuck, dude, I almost got the shrimps,

596
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,300
but I was like, I feel like everyone would yell at me.

597
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,600
- It's so good.

598
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,180
People were yelling at you a lot that day.

599
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,020
- They were.

600
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:19,860
- I don't know why.

601
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,780
- I was hungover.

602
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,020
- People are too hard on you, Pat.

603
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,860
- Yep.

604
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,060
- You get yelled at though, there you go.

605
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,900
- I get yelled at for, I don't know.

606
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:30,420
you remember what I did. Just being yourself. Just goofing around. Probably. That's all

607
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:41,420
I was doing. Messed up bro. What was that crap? SHUT UP! I believe you got the chicken sandwich.

608
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,900
I got the chicken and the potatoes with that sauce. Which is good. That sauce was good

609
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,780
as hell. I did not like the sauce for some reason. You didn't? It really looked like

610
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:54,060
I tried it multiple times. It did. The sauce is very brown.

611
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,580
The peanut one. No, he got the normal ones.

612
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,700
Oh yeah. I got the normal potatoes and then I tried them and I was like,

613
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,820
damn, they're good.

614
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,260
And I got the, Oh, Oh. And then I ate the garnish on that drink.

615
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,700
Ew. Is there anything more delicious than garnish?

616
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,780
Garnish is so good. I get so hungry for micro greens.

617
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,100
Dude, dude, like kale used to just be a garnish.

618
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,660
And then people started eating then these damn hipsters started eating.

619
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,220
Oh my God, don't get me started on these fucking freaks.

620
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,620
I mean, most garnish is just like the top of a vegetable that they cut off, right?

621
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,460
Yeah, I wish most hipsters were vegetables that would get cut off from their damn parents.

622
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,060
Yeah, what's up?

623
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,460
Throw them in a stew, cook them up.

624
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,560
Yeah, I want to throw them in a passion pit.

625
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,060
I would eat a hipster's poop.

626
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Yeah, would you eat a hipster's poop?

627
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,560
Depends.

628
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,660
Yeah, they're just drinking coffee.

629
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,160
Yeah, cheers.

630
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,860
No food in there.

631
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,260
It's the black brick.

632
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,660
It's just...

633
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,460
Caffeine bomb.

634
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,160
That'd be awesome.

635
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
I want to throw these.

636
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,360
- The hipsters' poops probably freakin' plaid anyway.

637
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,520
- I wanna throw these hipsters into a passion pit

638
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,720
and then hit 'em with an iron

639
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,360
until their blood flows like wine.

640
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,600
- Yup, yup. - I don't understand

641
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,000
the reference. - Yeah, I would like

642
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
to be a vampire for a weekend

643
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
and bite some of these hipsters.

644
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,960
(laughing)

645
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,520
- Yup. - I hope they get--

646
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,160
- I'd like to take my mom's Ford

647
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,760
and drive it into their son's.

648
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,800
- I would like to lay down on a mat and kill myself.

649
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:13,080
(laughing)

650
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,640
- I want to squish them between two doors

651
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,480
at the cinema club.

652
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:22,280

654
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,160
yeah where on the street I saw your money I saw a guy on the street today

655
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,360
homeless person. He's a hipster. He smells soap. He's a fucking hipster. I saw a hipster on the train.

656
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,560
Oh, he's too cool. I saw a hipster on a train. He's walking around with his, he's got a little cup and he's

657
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,360
shaking coins in him. It's like, hey, I don't want to hear your song. Yeah. I don't want to hear this

658
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,560
song. This is bullshit, man. Yeah. Kick the coins out of his fucking hands. I mean, you know in like five years

659
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,560
they're going to be bragging like I was dressing in cardboard before it was cool. That's right.

660
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,960
It's so fucking annoying. On the way to the office today, I saw a guy, he's standing in the middle of

661
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
the road and he was dancing and he was wearing a paper bag on his head with like the handles

662
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,960
over his ears.

663
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,960
Fucking hipster bitch.

664
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,960
Hipster.

665
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Yeah, it was pretty cool.

666
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
He was doing that before.

667
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,960
He was dancing.

668
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
He was doing music?

669
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
No, he was just dancing.

670
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
He was kind of doing like a hip thrust dance.

671
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Oh, you remember that guy who would wear all white in front of the, what building was that?

672
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,960
And he would dance?

673
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,960
In front of the gates of heaven.

674
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Yeah.

675
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,680
By the Boylston street stop, that building, like that Tremont intersection.

676
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,560
I saw, did I ever tell you, I saw that guy, he was like all white, he had a white cane,

677
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,480
He was just walking in the traffic on the Tremont and Boylston thing and just like twirling

678
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,400
his cane around and just looking at cars going like, "Hmm?"

679
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,440
And then someone started recording him like there and he like ran over them and was like,

680
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
"Stop fucking doing that!"

681
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
That's so funny.

682
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,320
Yeah, it's like you're doing that.

683
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,680
This is for people who are here.

684
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
This is in the moment.

685
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
You know, it's like a concert.

686
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,160
You shouldn't be just holding your phone up.

687
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Yeah, exactly.

688
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
Experience it.

689
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,080
I always saw that guy and I was like, he could never eat like a hot dog.

690
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,840
It would like ruin his entire outfit.

691
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,040
He was in like a white suit?

692
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:13,400
He was a full white t-shirt, white pants, white shoes, white hat.

693
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
Yeah, he had like a white bowler hat too.

694
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,640
White skin?

695
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,200
Black skin.

696
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,840
Black as night.

697
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,880
Africa black, dude.

698
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Darkest depths of Africa, bro.

699
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,000
Yeah, yeah, but the white shirt was immaculate.

700
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,040
It was crazy.

701
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,800
He would stand out in front of that building that played the radio.

702
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,920
And he would like dance to the music?

703
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,520
He would stand there and just dance to the radio.

704
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
He was cool.

705
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Oh, oh wait.

706
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
I kind of did.

707
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,240
It was like the worst song ever played.

708
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,120
He was like, oh my God.

709
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,480
I remember that guy.

710
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
That was me.

711
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,560
He had some good tunes.

712
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,320
He never, I never saw him in Sebulba interact.

713
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,720
I miss the vagrant street people of Boston, Massachusetts.

714
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,080
You do better than the ones here.

715
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
The ones here are sad.

716
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
They are way better than these ones.

717
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
They are sad.

718
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
These freaking losers.

719
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
They don't do any like dances.

720
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
None of them have it.

721
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,440
I don't like on the line. None of them, none of them here have any character.

722
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,400
Yeah, yeah, you're the guy. I feel like I'm watching a TV show. Remember the

You hurt people. You hurt people.

You stand in line and you hold hands and make a wall and you run across the field and try to like

Running around and hitting your friends. That was a fun one too.

811
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,120
In kindergarten, the girls played kissy girls.

812
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,120
Holy shit.

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,120

Yeah.

824
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,120
So you try to hit a bird with a golf ball.

825
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,520
golf ball. Yeah.

826
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,960
Yeah. Throwing rocks at the teacher's car in the parking lot in the back of the playground.

827
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,720
Every time I was like nine years old, I went to my friend's house and we tried to record

828
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,180
ourselves doing jackass. Oh yeah. And we recorded just straight up just me throwing a nine volt

829
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:30,160
battery at his garage door. And we were like, warning, these stunts are performed by professionals.

830
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,920
We used to do that shit too. I remember I would, well, my brother.

831
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:39,080
I thought the battery was going to explode. My brother would just make me do shit. You

832
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,580
you just make me hurt myself on my balls and then he would film it for his

833
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:47,480
jackass thing and one of them I like it was like January 1st and I jumped into

834
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,760
the ocean and it was like so cold and there's the entire thing because I just

835
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,160
jumped into cold water and he's like whoa jackass awesome. I had to feel good

836
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,680
as a little kid being like your brother. Yeah cool good job buddy. Yeah and then

837
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,400
I remember this is not for jackass. We used to make homemade stink bombs at a

838
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,380
dog poop yeah, we should throw him at my friend a little bit one of the best

839
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,260
jackass stunts. Hey, hi, I'm Cameron and this is running as fast as I can. It's

840
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:19,120
cool because I don't have a golf cart. I wanted one so bad. I know me and my

841
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,360
brother, we would look at golf carts online all day. That's like a beach

842
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:26,860
thing. I feel like is people drive golf carts around. Yeah, like some yeah. If

843
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,700
you live on like like there's like an island in North Carolina, you're not

844
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,860
allowed to have a car. You can only have a golf cart. Oh yeah, yeah, fucking I

845
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,600
I think like Myrtle Beach is kind of like that a little bit.

846
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,560
- Yeah, there's parts of it

847
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,760
where you can only have a golf cart.

848
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,040
- It's cool. - That'd be so fucking cool

849
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,880
to have a golf cart. - That would be so sick.

850
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,700
- You don't use your car at all,

851
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,800
everything's so close. - I want one here.

852
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,640
I want a golf cart. - My neighbor,

853
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,200
my neighbor Justin. - Just go to the front.

854
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,600
- Oh my God. - It'd be perfect, dude.

855
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,520
- Yeah. - That would be cool.

856
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,740
- My neighbor Justin had a go-cart,

857
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,440
which is the sickest shit. - Whoa.

858
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
- Yeah, I don't know how the fuck,

859
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
like he had a go-cart and like he was like the--

860
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,800
- My neighbor Mario had a go-cart.

861
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,480
(laughing)

862
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,020
My neighbor had a hovercraft.

863
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,520
My neighbor Dr. Einstein had a hovercraft.

864
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Dr. Zingbop.

865
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,320
I don't know how it worked at all.

866
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
Zingbop!

867
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Dr. Zingbop's hovercraft.

868
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,640
He always wanted to test his crazy inventions.

869
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,240
There's this crazy one where my neighbor growing up wanted me to drive his car to the past,

870
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,760
to the future, back to the future.

871
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
Oh my god.

872
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
Shut up.

873
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
So crazy.

874
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
Did you guys see Cowboys?

875
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,840
know that you did but you only did it twice. If you had done it again you would have sung

876
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,240
Cowboys. He doesn't fuck his mom in the movie. Yeah he does. Remember he starts to disappear.

877
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:45,080
You didn't see the director's cut. It's like Blade Runner. Yeah. The final cut. It's like

878
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:51,520
Blade Runner where the original cut had a narration and it's just Michael J. Fox like

879
00:36:51,520 --> 00:37:00,520
"Whoa, this is heavy. I'm about to have sex with my own mom. Her boobs are amazing. Crap."

880
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:10,520
"Oh crap." "Oh crap." "No going back now. Here I go."

881
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,520
"Yahoo!" "Yippee!"

882
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,520
That's what I always, that's what I say out loud when I do the deed.

883
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,520
you do well with your mom? When I post that shit, when Joe has sex with his mom he says yahoo. Wahoo!

884
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,520
That's not true, I don't do that. I would never. Well what do you do then? What do you do?

885
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
[Laughter]

886
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,520
And he goes [mimics Joe's sex sounds]

887
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
He goes, "Ow!" [mimics Joe's sex sounds]

888
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,520
I'm a step man!

889
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,520
It's actually not funny because like I love my mom and I'd like... Yeah you love your mom like a lot, right?

890
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,520
I would, like it's not even funny to joke about because I wouldn't ever even think about doing something so

891
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
disgusting and so

892
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
gross as

893
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:55,080
saying yeah, it's my friends to even suggest that feels like a personal insult to me as a person and a personal insult to the

894
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,600
Years that we've known each other. Would you rather eat a stranger's poop or your mom's?

895
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,880
I'd probably go

896
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,800
Stranger really? Yeah, I need my mom. It's it's just it's just the mom's poop is gonna be like comfortable though

897
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:20,320
It's it's it coming out on a plate or is it moms poop was a home cooked home cooked mom's poop or five-star

898
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Michelin poop five star Michelin poop every day. That's -

899
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,320
If you gave like

900
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:36,640
You gave like if you did like I don't trust my mom to prepare like a chop style thing

901
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,880
Where it's like you have to create the best meal you can with poop in it. That'd be a really good cookie

902
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,880
I think we should get a touch of like Netflix or Hulu or something.

903
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,880
That's a channel choice but it's gotta be a mammal.

904
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
I put my...

905
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,880
That's a cutthroat kitchen.

906
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I know, yeah, that'd be great.

907
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
I shaved flakes of poop like in the middle of a bowl.

908
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
He's giving people like nerds and like skittles,

909
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
being like, "Oh, you gotta do this."

910
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
And also...

911
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,880
The curtain goes up and he's shitting.

912
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Well, that's what would happen.

913
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
I'd be trying to make like a poop souffle or something

914
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,880
and it would deflate and at the end

915
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,780
end I would be panic. I just put it into like the blast freezer and just make

916
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,780
poop ice cream in like two minutes. I think you probably want to kind of

917
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,500
reduce it down and make like a sauce. No, because that's gonna make it more more

918
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,160
like concentrated. And then you're just gonna add a bunch of like, I already had

919
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:33,040
you're gonna add a bunch of like sweet and savory to just like push it out. I feel like you have to go with an extreme temperature if you're serving poop. You're so lucky.

920
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,280
That's what Cameron said, the flash freezer. But then I just I wouldn't want

921
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,240
want any poop texture to still exist within the dish.

922
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,600
You dehydrate the poop and shave it like a truffle.

923
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:47,240
I just want it to be the least amount of poop on it.

924
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
For me, most.

925
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I'm just rolling it in bread crumbs, that's it.

926
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
Deep fry it.

927
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,640
I mean honestly, if you went flat enough, I feel like you could probably do something

928
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
interesting with it.

929
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,640
This is poop in the air fryer.

930
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,680
Have you guys ever seen the episode of Hoarders where the lady, she puts poop on her food?

931
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,220
you know, horders about that, though it's pretty awesome. You get all over her

932
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:18,840
house, like flakes of poo, and then she like slates sprinkles it on her. How

933
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:23,120
are the flakes like dried flakes from like the toilet bowl? They're like

934
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,840
goes over the toilet bowl and scoops it out. I don't think they show that, but

935
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,400
they do show like the charts on her food. I just do it. That's not actually

936
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,600
poop, because she can't be yeah. No, that shows someone eating poop on

937
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,620
Yeah, you can. You can definitely show that. You can show it to everyone on television.

938
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,620
I think they can fake that because they're like, "Oh, this would be funny."

939
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,620
You can't show Two Girls One Cup because it's too sexual.

940
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,620
But if someone ate it...

941
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
Because it's actually kind of hot.

942
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Yeah, you could show one guy one cup.

943
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,620
Yeah, you could show Dave England eating a poop.

944
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,620
Yeah, definitely.

945
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,620
But you couldn't show Two Girls One Cup.

946
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,620
Well, you could show Two Girls One Cup, period, but I don't think...

947
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,620
You could show Two Girls One Cup.

948
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,620
You could show that to you right now.

949
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,620
You can show it on HBO. Two kids one TV.

950
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,120
really like to watch it for the first time, like three years ago, and I

951
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,500
almost I like wanted to vomit. It's so fun to girls one cup because the

952
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,060
funnest part of it is that they're pretending to like it yeah, which is

953
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,780
like it. I think one of them died after I don't know one of the women

954
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,420
died. That's certainly like a two dozen eight and I got married. No, she

955
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,020
got attacked by aliens.

956
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,220
They fell in love.

957
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,240
I heard it was the first

958
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,240
That was the first date.

959
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,240
That's how they got engaged.

960
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,240
She pooped the ring out.

961
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Yeah.

962
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
It's a great story of meeting.

963
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
She pooped the ring out and turned to her and said, "Will you marry me?"

964
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
She pooped the ring out, then the other one ate it, and then she pooped the ring out with

965
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,240
the poop.

966
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
Yeah.

967
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
And then gave it to her.

968
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,240
She threw it up.

969
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
She threw the ring out.

970
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Do you think you could poop the ring onto the finger if you stick the finger in the butt

971
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
hole?

972
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,240
No, because the poop would push it out.

973
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
The poop is solid.

974
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,240
Okay, guys, listen.

975
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
It's a soft poop.

976
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,240
This is way too much poop talk.

977
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,240
We already talked about this.

978
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
We already talked about this.

979
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
We already talked about this.

980
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,240
stick the finger on the butt of it.

981
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,080
The poop would push it out.

982
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,080
The poop is solid.

983
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,080
Okay guys, listen.

984
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,080
It's a soft poop.

985
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
This is way too much poop talk.

986
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
We have to stop.

987
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
We have to go to the list.

988
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,240
Would you rather drink carbonated pee or eat pee ice cream?

989
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,280
Well, it would be pee sorbet.

990
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
Would it be airy in it?

991
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
Because it's yellow and stuff?

992
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
Yeah.

993
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,120
Pee ice cream, it's just like pee and it tastes like pee.

994
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,760
I guess like pee snow cone maybe.

995
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I did that in Czech.

996
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Wait, what's the first one?

997
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Yeah.

998
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,160
carbonated pea soda. I feel like carbonated pea actually. Pea soda?

999
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,580
Carbonated pea goes down easier.

1000
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,220
But then you're going to burp and taste it again.

1001
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:34,140
Oh, true. I go ice cream. I love ice cream.

1002
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,900
I'd go carbonated pea.

1003
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,380
You would?

1004
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,900
Cause I could convince myself that that's like a broth.

1005
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:39,940
What is in here?

1006
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:40,780
Carbonated?

1007
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,940
I could convince, I could drink pea if I convinced myself it was chicken broth.

1008
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,580
I don't think you could do that.

1009
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,860
That would take a really...

1010
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:51,340
That's so pun- I'm sorry, I just like smelled the monster.

1011
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,660
He opened a Pringles can.

1012
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,740
I opened the Pringles because I was like, "Why is this so heavy?"

1013
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,260
And it has Patrick's monster in it and then I just got like a whiff of the monster mixed

1014
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,260
with the chili.

1015
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,260
Oh, chili lime scorch and Pringles.

1016
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,780
It just smells so gross.

1017
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,740
Patrick's chip corner.

1018
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Pretty good chip.

1019
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
I don't like Patrick's chip corner.

1020
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,740
You really like flavors and stuff.

1021
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,740
What?

1022
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:14,460
You look like a- What?

1023
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,660
You like like a new flavor.

1024
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,300
You're a sucker for like a new brand.

1025
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:24,420
he's the modern man did he only eat things that are bright red and drinks

1026
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,340
things that taste like and you have a four monster cans plus one is one of

1027
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,460
those is a Pringles can.

1028
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,700
Why do you do that though?

1029
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,660
You imagine I've ever seen him eat like a fruit. I was just saying the same

1030
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:42,140
thing with Alex. I've never seen him eat like a salad. I'm allergic to most

1031
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:47,620
raw vegetables and how are you? How does God make you allergic to fruit and not

1032
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,640
- How is this even possible that that is better in your--

1033
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,240
- I'm alert, dude, I can't, if I eat a raw carrot,

1034
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,560
my lip will swell up.

1035
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,640
I can't do, like--

1036
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,280
- That's why nobody's asking you to eat a raw carrot.

1037
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,240
- Remember when you came into my work and you were like,

1038
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,840
"Can I get something for free?"

1039
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,160
And I was like, "Yeah, you can have any,

1040
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,040
"pick like a juice, like a Natalie's juice."

1041
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,880
- Those are like eight bucks.

1042
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,240
- They're eight bucks, but I just gave it to you

1043
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
and then you drank it and then you immediately

1044
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,680
had an allergic reaction to the drink

1045
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,080
and then you had to go home.

1046
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,920
(laughing)

1047
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:13,760
- Ew, that's so--

1048
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,600
- Your face just got like--

1049
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,440
- It was so gross.

1050
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,280
- It was so gross.

1051
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,280
Your face just got really puffy.

1052
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,280
There was carrot juice in it.

1053
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,280
You didn't think to check it?

1054
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
So funny.

1055
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:27,640
I've done that so many times, I forget to ask for no guacamole on al pastor tacos.

1056
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
Every time.

1057
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,160
I've seen that first hand.

1058
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,160
Yeah.

1059
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,280
This magic bean is so specific about what kind of tacos he does.

1060
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,360
Well al pastor is like best with guac.

1061
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,880
I wish I could eat guac dude.

1062
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:50,880
I don't every Mexican food in the world. What they put guac on everything.

1063
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,080
No, they don't. They do. No, they don't put it on beer. I think what you're

1064
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,000
saying is that with al pastor guacamole is so good. Someone who finally

1065
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,900
understands me on here. Is that true? Is an al pastor the pineapple one?

1066
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:09,100
Yeah, I don't think they usually put guac on that. They do every place I

1067
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,640
and al pastor that's because they look like this guy's probably allergic to

1068
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,720
let's see we're gonna make this guy blow up we want to do a mr. Korea so to him we

1069
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:22,200
want to turn this guy to the human pufferfish yeah I'm not allergic to

1070
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:26,520
really anything yeah yeah you're probably such a great you're probably

1071
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,120
allergic to death I probably would not have a great reaction to that yeah yeah

1072
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:41,120
I'm also a zero. Allergic. I'm a zero. I'm a zero. I'm pretty much a zero though. Although

1073
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,960
I would at birthdays in like elementary school I would eat the rice cakes sometimes. Tastes

1074
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
better than a cake. That's for the kids who are allergic. Yeah if you're allergic you

1075
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,320
usually bring in a stash for birthday celebrations. Rice cakes. Do you guys not do that? For the

1076
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,480
nerds. That wasn't a universal school thing? No. None of my school. We didn't know. We

1077
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,140
- We didn't bring in cupcakes.

1078
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,280
- We didn't go to freaking Joni Mitchell High School.

1079
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:05,120
- You didn't bring in cupcakes on your birthday or whatever?

1080
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,960
- We don't know.

1081
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,800
- Like donuts, munchkins?

1082
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,280
- I had a summer birthday.

1083
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,660
- We brought in dirt and pennies.

1084
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,500
We need that.

1085
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,340
- Damn, that was so bad.

1086
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,160
- We're so poor.

1087
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,000
- Yeah, we bought in tuppence.

1088
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:14,840
- Yeah.

1089
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,360
(blows raspberry)

1090
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,200
- Tuppence.

1091
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,320
- I went to school in a chimney.

1092
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,420
- We bought in tuppence, dog.

1093
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,260
- I just thought this was--

1094
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:22,100
- It's the fucking tuppence.

1095
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,120
- Yeah, did you ever watch Matilda?

1096
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:25,960
- Yeah.

1097
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,520
- So that school, that wasn't my school,

1098
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,480
but inside the chokie that was my school.

1099
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,580
It was like a school within a school.

1100
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,680
- Have you ever watched Matilda?

1101
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,520
- No.

1102
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,760
(laughing)

1103
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,740
- What's up?

1104
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:38,580
- Huh?

1105
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,420
(laughing)

1106
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,240
- My cousin is in Matilda.

1107
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,380
- Yo, what the fuck?

1108
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,460
- My life was like Matilda since Mrs. Trunchbull.

1109
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,060
(laughing)

1110
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,180
- We talked about this one time

1111
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,860
and I've thought about it maybe like just everyday since

1112
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,360
is that that chocolate cake in Matilda,

1113
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,200
I wanna eat that so bad.

1114
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,020
- Oh my God.

1115
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,860
- It grossed me out, bro.

1116
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,080
I thought when she says I put blood and sweat into it,

1117
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:56,920
I thought when I was a kid--

1118
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,920
I don't like it's a blood cake. Are you kidding me? That is probably trunchbull

1119
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,360
sweat. Oh my God. You want that bull crap dude that no it's not miss

1120
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:08,040
trunchbull. I want her to sweat me by my damn pigtails. It's the cafeteria.

1121
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,920
The lunch lady's sweat. Oh then never mind. Miss trunchbull. But that

1122
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,640
chocolate cake looks so good. What's the miss day? What's the ones thing?

1123
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,520
Miss honey. Miss honey. Miss honey. Miss honey. Miss honey. Miss honey.

1124
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:20,200
It just makes you want to like.

1125
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:24,280
Yep. That movie makes you want to like your teachers. It's a good. They did

1126
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,520
a good job with you want to like miss trunchbull. No, I would say that movie

1127
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,120
makes me want to have magic powers

1128
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,360
teachers

1129
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,440
levitate

1130
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,000
the cake look at bat and I like teachers.

1131
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,560
The cake looks so good. I thought the cake look terrible. Yeah, I want to see

1132
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:43,920
like a

1133
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,800
cake looks so good. I thought they're like well, okay, the kids with the kid

1134
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:51,800
is ugly and fat, but the cake looks really good. I wanted it to be a milk

1135
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:52,600
bar cake.

1136
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,880
I thought when they eat the TV dinners in that movie,

1137
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,220
I always thought that looked really good.

1138
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:59,320
- Oh, the carriage in that movie looked good.

1139
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,760
- I did wanna eat the TV dinners too.

1140
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,280
- The TV dinner in Matilda,

1141
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,160
I always thought that looked good when I was a kid.

1142
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,000
- Their house is nice.

1143
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,160
- I would love to eat Danny DeVito.

1144
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,000
- Yeah.

1145
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,080
- Yeah, roast him on a spit.

1146
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,280
- He honestly would be a delicious celebrity.

1147
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,000
- He would, he's probably one of the tastiest.

1148
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,520
- Putting him on a shwarm of spit and shaving him.

1149
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,080
- Imagine like lamb and beef gyro mix,

1150
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,920
Danny DeVito, Andy Milonakis.

1151
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,920
Oh my goodness.

1152
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,960
You know, I mean I think that Andy Malinakis is probably full of some weird stuff.

1153
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
Because he's Greek?

1154
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:29,960
No.

1155
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,600
Just like, I don't know.

1156
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,400
He'd be the perfect one to be half Euro.

1157
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,240
I feel like I would not want to eat Danny DeVito because I don't want to cut out, cut

1158
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,760
down on the rest of his body of work.

1159
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,760
I feel like if I...

1160
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Bruce Valanche.

1161
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,320
Imagine how much more you would enjoy watching his movies and TV shows if you knew he was

1162
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
inside you.

1163
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
At least until you pooped him out.

1164
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,080
That's not really how I look at stuff.

1165
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,400
You don't look at stuff like that?

1166
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
Preston Lacey.

1167
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,400
Preston Lacey.

1168
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,960
Why are you trying to eat like big fat?

1169
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,360
I heard they're going to do that in Jackass Pot.

1170
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,360
Preston Lacey would have like...

1171
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
Can they all eat Preston Lacey?

1172
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,360
It's like the scene in Day of the Dead.

1173
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:01,360
Preston Lacey would be too raw.

1174
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:02,360
That'd be a tough butcher job, Preston Lacey.

1175
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,360
You want like 15% fat.

1176
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,360
I think Jack Black would be pretty good.

1177
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,360
Jack Black would be tasty.

1178
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,360
No.

1179
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,360
Yeah.

1180
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,360
You guys are making too...

1181
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,360
I feel like you're making like 50/50 fat.

1182
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:10,360
Probably.

1183
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,360
Have you ever seen a Wagyu?

1184
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,360
I've never seen a Wagyu.

1185
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
I've never seen a Wagyu.

1186
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,360
I've never seen a Wagyu.

1187
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,360
I've never seen a Wagyu.

1188
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,480
Jack Black would be tasty.

1189
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:16,980
No.

1190
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:17,480
Yeah.

1191
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:18,560
You guys are picking too--

1192
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,160
like, I feel like you're picking 50/50.

1193
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:20,660
Probably.

1194
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,720
Have you ever seen a wagyu beef cow?

1195
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:24,220
A wagyu?

1196
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,800
Yeah, they're fat as well.

1197
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,260
But I feel like you want someone--

1198
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,240
100% wagyu beef.

1199
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,640
Jack Black is made of wagyu beef.

1200
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,220
You know, like the prefectures in Japan, where the people live

1201
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:37,280
to like 120, because they have a very specific diet of rice

1202
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,880
and fish.

1203
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,400
And I feel like you want someone--

1204
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,240
So OK, I would just eat those Japanese people.

1205
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,740
I'm just saying like you want like a grass-fed cow.

1206
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,240
The equivalent of a grass-fed cow.

1207
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,540
So like a vegetarian or vegan person.

1208
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,040
No.

1209
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,240
Or a big fat person with lots of meat.

1210
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,240
You want a big fat.

1211
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,940
You want somebody full of fat.

1212
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,140
Are you gonna eat a whole person in one go?

1213
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,740
I mean, if you're eating...

1214
00:49:58,740 --> 00:49:59,340
Well, not in one go.

1215
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,240
It's meal prep.

1216
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,040
I'd have like my freezer in the basement.

1217
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,240
That would be like, I'd like write "Preston" on the lid and I'd just have that for a month.

1218
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,740
How long are you planning on eating?

1219
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,240
Is this not one, this is forever?

1220
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,740
You're trying to like sustain your...

1221
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,740
It's however long it takes me to eat him.

1222
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,620
I mean then I'm gonna next alarm you don't know you get one cow you have a

1223
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,900
big freezer you probably yeah you probably would try to be trying to

1224
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:24,300
UberEATS Jack Black yeah you try to get the ultimate Jack Black burger that now

1225
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,460
that's a there's an app idea and UberEATS where you can order different

1226
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,580
celebrities yeah like all of them are just like they're all a satellite

1227
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:36,100
kitchens anyway true so if you're getting Jack Black you could be getting a

1228
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,260
Jack Black impersonator I just don't know if I could really come around on

1229
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,460
murdering a human being for this. You wouldn't be murdering them, you'd just be eating them.

1230
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,300
You're following just like a serial killer kills these people just by chance.

1231
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,980
It's the same thing with like a restaurant where I don't want to see the cow that I'm eating.

1232
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:57,180
Also you can't, for whatever reason, even though it is

1233
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:02,700
blackjack black, you're like, "I ate it." Even though it is blackjack.

1234
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:07,100
You can't identify the body. Well probably nobody can.

1235
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,380
I don't have like the head with the apple.

1236
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,220
- Well yeah.

1237
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,060
- Well you also, it's like,

1238
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,420
I know you don't wanna see the cow

1239
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,620
before you eat it or whatever,

1240
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,100
but I feel like seeing the celebrity

1241
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:15,260
before you eat them is different

1242
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,940
'cause you see them, like it's like awesome

1243
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:17,780
when you see them.

1244
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:18,600
- They have a good life.

1245
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,440
- Like when you see the cow, it's like sad.

1246
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,280
- Oh, yeah.

1247
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,260
- You're not taking a photo with the cow with droopy eyes.

1248
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,100
Like.

1249
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,700
(laughing)

1250
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,340
- But if I like watch School of Rock,

1251
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,980
I'm like, oh, I'm excited to eat this guy.

1252
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,300
- Taking a selfie with Jack Black

1253
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,460
before he like goes into the slaughterhouse.

1254
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,300
(laughing)

1255
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,660
- Before they just put the bolt in his head.

1256
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:37,160
- He's just jet blacked out.

1257
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,400
(laughing)

1258
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,600
- He's still rock and roll.

1259
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,840
- He's skadoosh.

1260
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,080
(laughing)

1261
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:47,940
- As you like turn up.

1262
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,940
- Watch out!

1263
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,920
- That's what they do.

1264
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,420
- That's pretty hot, dude.

1265
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,260
That's hot.

1266
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,420
- They shoot the bolt into his head.

1267
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,820
He just goes, watch out!

1268
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:58,660
- Ow!

1269
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:00,900
(laughing)

1270
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,220
- What's that bolt, Crest?

1271
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:04,900
- He goes like just completely rigid.

1272
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,860
can do it around like a piece of wood.

1273
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:17,900
Well, we kill Jack Black. It's so quiet. Now we can finally think

1274
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,100
everyone. Oh my God, I've got the best all the cure for cancer. Oh my

1275
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,000
God, all carbon emissions halt in the world. Everyone builds

1276
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,700
futuristic because he's walking around doing funny for it. Yeah,

1277
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,780
he was in like the psychic energy of the human race. He was did yeah the guy who

1278
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,500
was supposed to cure cancer got distracted by kick a poo. Yeah

1279
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,800
Patrick starts wearing button down shirts.

1280
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,300
I don't know what happened. You're a lawyer.

1281
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,500
Oh, good evening. Everybody gets British

1282
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,500
only American accent.

1283
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,500
He's like he's like a an emissary of the devil. He's put here to like

1284
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
inhibit the potential of humanity.

1285
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,500
He is, dude. His fucking rock crap is fucking driving me crazy.

1286
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Yeah, tribute devil thing.

1287
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,500
Yeah. Remember, Paul F. Tompkins is the devil in the movie.

1288
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,500
Yep. Is he?

1289
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:12,500
I think so.

1290
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,500
And then we ought to eat him too.

1291
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,500
Paul F. Tompkins turns into the devil once he gets the pick of destiny.

1292
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,500
So, okay, we should just eat everybody that's in the Tenacious D movie.

1293
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
Dave Grohl.

1294
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Yeah, he's still-- I thought the-- no, the other one died.

1295
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,500
Yeah, well, Dave Grohl will soon.

1296
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Did we already talk about this, how Dave Grohl denied AIDS?

1297
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,500
No.

1298
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:30,500
I think you said it was cool.

1299
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,780
Like he thought it was cool.

1300
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:36,060
He thought it was cool to be like AIDS isn't real for like 15 years.

1301
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,060
Wow.

1302
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:38,060
Pretty crazy.

1303
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:39,060
Damn.

1304
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,940
It's just like how can you feel so strongly about it that you're going to take that stance?

1305
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:48,140
Yeah, they were like doing benefit concerts to like benefit the idea that AIDS did not

1306
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,140
exist.

1307
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,140
Just to make the AIDS people spend more money on it.

1308
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,100
That's not a benefit concert, that's a drawback concert.

1309
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,100
Yeah, they were like, it was like a...

1310
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:04,820
like vacuum to suck up the money. Red Cross. He's cool though. Dave Grohl. It's sad they

1311
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:09,300
made the devil movie right as the guy went to hell. I think they invited it on themselves

1312
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:13,220
by courting the devil. It is bro. It's like the Pulcher guys. They made a movie about

1313
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:17,180
the devils. They made a movie where they're recording their new haunted house. Studio

1314
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:21,380
666. Yeah you didn't see the trailer for it? It was on a few movies. It was on ahead of

1315
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,380
have a few big movies. I feel like it was on B. Flick. So it is in theaters. I

1316
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:30,900
got about B. Flick. What's B. Flick? Lady on Fortnight told us to check out B.

1317
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,940
Flick. See, we just told you. We're like, Oh, you have to go see Morbius in

1318
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,220
the theater. It's going to blow your mind. And she's like, I don't really

1319
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,620
watch movies in the theater. I usually watch them on B. Flick.

1320
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:44,860
She's like B. Flick. It's got all the movies.

1321
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:50,500
And then her husband is like some like, yeah, some fake streaming service that

1322
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:55,640
couldn't find called Beeflix or if you just think Netflix is called Beeflix.

1323
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:58,240
What did that guy say at the zoo?

1324
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,240
What was his company called?

1325
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,240
Oh I can't remember.

1326
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,240
Yeah, he was like.

1327
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,720
Yeah, there was a guy who was talking to us.

1328
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,600
We're trying to do the thing with Alex with the face paint.

1329
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,760
And there's just a guy who came up to us and he was like, "Have you guys heard of like

1330
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:11,760
Capture Reimagine?"

1331
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,840
And I was just like, "Oh, I don't know.

1332
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
I don't know if I've heard of it."

1333
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:15,840
He's like, "No, no, no.

1334
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,840
Tell me.

1335
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Have you heard of it?"

1336
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,840
Have you heard of it?

1337
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,840
Yes or no.

1338
00:55:19,840 --> 00:55:21,040
It sounds like something I might have heard of

1339
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,120
and he's like, that's 'cause it doesn't exist yet.

1340
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:23,960
It's my idea.

1341
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,780
(laughing)

1342
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,620
Is that out yet?

1343
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,440
He's like, ah, is that out yet?

1344
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,680
Yeah, it doesn't exist yet.

1345
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,640
It's in my head.

1346
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,600
It might be on technology,

1347
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,320
but you know, I don't really like technology.

1348
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,160
It's in my head.

1349
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,400
(laughing)

1350
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,240
- That's pretty good.

1351
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,060
- We talked about this for like 30 minutes.

1352
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,900

and it's just a giant fucking breath of the wild.

1374
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,040
It's not a poster.

1375
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,240
It's like it's like wood.

1376
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:54,740

That stays in there. That's a nice wooden frame. We just

1387
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:46,780
Breath of the wild you are insane if you think we're getting rid of that you are psycho if you hate Lincoln

1388
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,020
I don't think I don't think either of you guys would stop me from I would I would stop you just bite him

1389
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,540
I would slap you silly

1390
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:01,060
It would hurt my feelings to see any one of us hurt like physically hurt another that's not hurt

1391
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,020
It's okay

1392
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,540
Like can you imagine what it would be?

1393
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:10,220
What would you feel if you saw like if you guys walked in you saw me like hit Alex really hard?

1394
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:16,260
In the face by one of our good friends who twice Neil

1395
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,540
Punched you in the face twice

1396
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:24,660
Twice like genuinely punched you in the face. I don't want to get into that story, but whoa

1397
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:28,260
Yeah, I

1398
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:34,040
Watched you throw Alex against the ground very violently like a nose gentle that was not gentle

1399
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:39,540
Yeah, it was you were really grabbing him. Yeah, actually no he didn't the first the first thing he tried to choke me

1400
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,780
You remember that we were at a party and he tried to Homer Bart you did try to Homer Bart me

1401
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,780
And then the second one was a

1402
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,460
Not a very touchy group of friends though. Yeah, no, I feel like like Noah was just here

1403
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:58,740
I realize whenever me and Noah are hanging out. We like push him around all the time. Yeah. Yeah, and we touch each other

1404
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:10,120
Don't like that. Yeah, I feel like I've given you a hug like twice and anytime I do it I'm like

1405
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:17,140
We pushed each other around alone when he was in town was Jubio. Oh, yeah

1406
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:21,780
He's another guy who if he's here, I'll just try to push him over for no reason.

1407
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:22,740
Because he's so tall.

1408
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,900
He looks like he'd be real easy to push over because his head is so big and full of liquid.

1409
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,140
He has a hydrocephaly.

1410
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,820
My head is full of Haritos.

1411
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,740
It is, dude. It's bubbling. You can hear it in his ears if you get close enough.

1412
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,900
It's true. It's tamarind Haritos.

1413
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:41,940
If he goes past like a 45 degree angle, just all the liquid just pours out of his ears.

1414
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,340
Yeah.

1415
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:47,540
yeah there's a guy in school who used to like fight with his friends the

1416
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,460
principal yeah the principal

1417
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:54,260
morning announcements. If you excuse me, my friend,

1418
00:59:54,260 --> 01:00:00,500
nice try, Derek. Derek dress up as a ninja. Try to attack me. I was doing

1419
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,300
the word of the day is

1420
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,580
word of the day.

1421
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:14,820
I went to the word high school. I went to word high school on

1422
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:19,460
Sesame Street. It's in ninth grade. He's in a college prep class. The word of the

1423
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:25,620
day is banana. No, they would have a word of the day at my high school and it would be like

1424
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:30,820
hope or inspire or something like that. Every day they would end up. You could have just

1425
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:36,500
cycled back and forth. Today is inspire. Today's word is creativity. They used to play music

1426
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:41,420
on the announcements in the morning. It was pretty tight. I went to old fashioned school

1427
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,700
where they just announced stuff on the damn announcements. Am I right? Kids nowadays want

1428
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:49,020
to play music, do words of the day. I don't know what this bull crap is. You had a PA

1429
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,920
system in every room that played it yes we didn't we didn't have that they we

1430
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:57,300
used to tell the janitor to come get kids to like go to the principal's office

1431
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:02,880
yeah yeah the janitor would like knock on door be like fuck mr. wolf wants to see

1432
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,840
this one mr. wolf

1433
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:12,460
what big what big eyes you have mr. it's probably a good prank to do on your

1434
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:16,740
principal speaking of the word of the day you guys should go check out the

1435
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:23,940

1439
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,840
putting together just a general vibe of like good fun. Would you say it's a

1440
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:42,640
variety show called the home planet show? I would say it's a variety show

1441
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,140
called the home planet show. Would you say that people could expect to

1442
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,500
encounter a white thug on this kind of show? I would say perhaps. Probably in the

1443
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,100
future. Perhaps. Given a word like because we don't really find the word of the

1444
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,860
weeks come to us it's not we don't choose them so if there's an appropriate

1445
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:08,540
one maybe. Thug. White. The week is white. White. White dash thug. I don't know Patrick can do a cartwheel. Perhaps. Would you say you could do a cartwheel?

1446
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,540
- I'm asking you.

1447
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:10,540
- No, say no.

1448
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,540
- I would say no.

1449
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:15,180
- I would say probably not, but I'm open to being wrong.

1450
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,180
- You should come on the show, do a curse.

1451
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:20,700
- So you guys are also posting video breakdowns.

1452
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:21,700
- Video breakdowns.

1453
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,700
- When you talk about a one minute video for two hours.

1454
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:23,700
- I'm in one of them.

1455
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:28,020
- We indulge in talking about things.

1456
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,380
- And then you have old videos.

1457
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,980
- Which are terrible videos from four years ago.

1458
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:36,060
- Where a lot of us are doing a lot of embarrassing things.

1459
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,060
- A lot of embarrassing things.

1460
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,060
- Whoa.

1461
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:38,900
- Whoa! - Whoa!

1462
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:39,740
- So it's over.

1463
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:40,560
- We're done.

1464
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:41,400
- That's really, that scared me.

1465
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,220
- All right.

1466
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:43,060
- That's too loud.

1467
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,220

1468
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,940
