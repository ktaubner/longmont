1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:15,000
- Whoa, the snap is crazy.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,600
- The snap looked cool though.

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,600
- It did look cool, but when it comes to

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,880
the technical purpose, it's woefully--

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,720
- We should burp out of a bowl.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,480
- I'm not too worried about the technical purpose.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,320
I'm an artist.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,600
- We should burp to sink it.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,440
- What?

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,640
- That would be some funny ass bullshit.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,480
but you don't understand how sync works.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,320
- Yeah.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,140
- No, 'cause--

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,980
- Bro doesn't know how a sync works,

16
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,820
he never watches anything.

17
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,440
- You burp real loud into it, real close,

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,800
like you do like that.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,040
Burp like real close like that.

20
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,680
- But that doesn't help you sync the audio

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,920
and the video at all.

22
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
You need to have something--

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,120
- A visual, maybe like a guy going like (burps)

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,480
- Yeah, but at what point in this, so, okay.

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,080
I'm gonna do a mind burp and you tell me when I burp, okay?

26
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,920
Ready?

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,740
- Yeah.

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,360
- So you didn't even know.

29
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,380
- What if for sinking it we used the gentle lapping

30
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,560
of the ocean's waves?

31
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,400
Maybe that could help sink it.

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,680
- That would be actually fucking beautiful.

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,320
- 'Cause you'd know it goes whoosh.

34
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,160
- True.

35
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,400
(laughing)

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,880
- Did you guys--

37
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,920
- I love when the ocean gets sucked up into my butthole

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,340
'cause it's so loose.

39
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,480
- No.

40
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
- What is wrong with you?

41
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,040
- You are in a rare form today.

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,360
- You're in a rare mood.

43
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,600
You kind of feel like, I'm kind of scared of you this morning.

44
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,440
- You're not scared of me.

45
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,520
- You brought-- - I'm a little bit thinking--

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,400
- You know what, I took muscle relaxers.

47
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,740
- You also, I don't, I--

48
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,200
(laughing)

49
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
- What?

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,800
You took a muscle relaxer?

51
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
- I took like five.

52
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,680
- What?

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,520
- Why?

54
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,320
- Read what the name of them is called.

55
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,160
- You just wanted to chill.

56
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,000
You wanted to chill.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,160
- No, I'm not on muscle relaxers.

58
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,000
- I used to take muscle-- - I was joking around.

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,560
- I took muscle relaxers one time and it didn't do anything.

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,560
- Yeah, just 'cause you're already so relaxed.

61
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
- Yeah. - 'Cause you're a cool breeze.

62
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,720
- The ultimate chiller.

63
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,480
- How can such a chiller get any more chill, man?

64
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,880
- You're the one who looks chill today.

65
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,800
- Yeah, I know.

66
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
- This is like we all look too chill.

67
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,560
- You look like you're chilling in a pile of dog hair.

68
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,400
Come on.

69
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,280
- You look like one of those LA guys

70
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,140
that rides like a Vespa.

71
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,040
- You look really scary when you do that.

72
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,480
Oh my God.

73
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,880
- You look like the Joker.

74
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,720
- No, I don't.

75
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
The Joker looks like this.

76
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
- 'Cause he's all around us,

77
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,920
'cause he could be any one of us.

78
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,760
- Oh my God. - That's true.

79
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,560
- 'Cause he's just got makeup on.

80
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,400
- That's true.

81
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,880
- But it's actually his skin.

82
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,560
- His white skin. - He fell to a big vat

83
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,640
of green goo. - Literally the whitest guy ever.

84
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,840
- You will never see a black joker on a movie.

85
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
Steve Harvey, one.

86
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
- What movie? - Bernie Mac, two.

87
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,440
- What movie?

88
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,520
- Cedric the Entertainer.

89
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,240
- Those are comedians. - The kings of comedy.

90
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,960
- Those are not jokers. - They're all black jokers.

91
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,520
- In what world are they jokers?

92
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,560
- They're telling jokes.

93
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,600
- But they're not going up there going,

94
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,080
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

95
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,000
- You don't know that.

96
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
There's definitely, look at Steve Harvey laugh.

97
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
- That is not how Steve Harvey laughs.

98
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,920
- I like how Harvey laughs.

99
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,100
- Steve Harvey does not go, "Oo-ee-ee-ee-ow-ow!"

100
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,940
- No, he doesn't.

101
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,500
- He may have done that once or twice,

102
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,080
but he doesn't say Batman.

103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,920
- He doesn't?

104
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,280
- Look right there, there's already...

105
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,580
- Oh yeah, I guess he does.

106
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,760
Alright, I don't think he...

107
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Oh man, he did dress just like that.

108
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,440
- Oh my gosh, that is the Joker's suit.

109
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,380
I didn't even consider that.

110
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,880
- But I mean, you just, it's...

111
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,460
- That is one of the most beautiful suits,

112
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,720
this is one of the most beautiful outfits

113
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,560
I've ever seen in my entire life.

114
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,560
- If they did a black Joker,

115
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,640
I mean, people would be,

116
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,600
it would destroy, the world would be over.

117
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,280
- Yeah, and why? - People would be protesting.

118
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,880
It'd be like--

119
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,660
- Oh, I was thinking about this.

120
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,500
- Yeah, yeah.

121
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,920
- 'Cause I don't know, you guys probably saw,

122
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,600
they're filming the second Joker movie.

123
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,440
- With Lady Gégea.

124
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,440
- Yeah, and Patrick's been shopping at Target recently.

125
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,960
You are Therese Rouchet.

126
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,800
- I am.

127
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,200
(laughing)

128
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,720
- But wouldn't it be funny,

129
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,480
'cause they already, they completely blew their load

130
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,720
with saying they're gonna kill people

131
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,840
in the first Joker movie.

132
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,680
- Yeah, you're right.

133
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,600
- And they're not gonna say it for the second one.

134
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,800
So if I was an evil guy--

135
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,840
- Nah, we won't even go there.

136
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
Nah, we on YouTube now.

137
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
- Oh yeah.

138
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,280
So I'll feel completely safe--

139
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,200
- What would you do, but I would write a movie

140
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,240
about how a guy would--

141
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,640
- It just seems like that's,

142
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,920
I'm not gonna see it in theaters.

143
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,680
- What would you do if it took place in Canada?

144
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,160
- Candyland, right?

145
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,000
- What?

146
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,840
- Just think about that.

147
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,920
- You are...

148
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
- What would you...

149
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,340
- Bzzzt!

150
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,380
- What would you do if what took place in Candyland?

151
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,160
- Like an imaginary world.

152
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
- If what?

153
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,240
- If an imaginary world took place in Candyland?

154
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,720
- You can describe it if it's happening

155
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,920
in an imaginary world, is what I'm trying to say.

156
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,120
- Oh, okay.

157
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,320
- Yeah, if it happened...

158
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,400
- Well, okay, if the Joker 2 premiere happened in Candyland,

159
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,720
I would not be in Candyland.

160
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
- Yeah.

161
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,380
- That's the, yeah.

162
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,380
- Somebody be loading candy corn in a nine millimeter clip.

163
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,380
You think that the second Joker movie is the one that's gonna have the shooting?

164
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm saying that's when they let their guard down.

165
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
I will just say that's the point.

166
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Think about it, which world war had Hitler in it?

167
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,380
Oh my fucking god.

168
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Both of them.

169
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,380
(laughter)

170
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,380
He was also...

171
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
That's crazy!

172
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
He was a round butt.

173
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,380
It's like when you see the Joker in the Batman.

174
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,380
In that cell.

175
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Yep.

176
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,380
You're right.

177
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,260
- I mean, the Riddler he wants to sell me.

178
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,860
- And also Hitler.

179
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,460
- Yeah, he sees Hitler from behind.

180
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,780
- Who do they get to play Hitler?

181
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,900
Oh my God.

182
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,820
- Isn't Hitler in the Captain America movie?

183
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,660
Didn't they play Hitler in that?

184
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,480
- No, no, no, no, no.

185
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,040
Because Hitler is like completely replaced

186
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,060
by Red Skull in the movies, I think.

187
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,660
- So Red Skull is Hitler.

188
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,500
I can't remember, he might, he may be.

189
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,060
- Red Skull's a red skull,

190
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,300
and he has a swastika still on his skull somehow.

191
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,140
Like right in the middle of his forehead.

192
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,620
- He has a swastika on his skull?

193
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,460
- Yeah, some designs.

194
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,300
- Well, it's also a mask, isn't it?

195
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,620
- Yeah, no.

196
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,140
- In the movie, I'm pretty sure it's a mask.

197
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,740
- No, you got a red, no, his normal face is a mask,

198
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,580
and the red skull is his face.

199
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,740
- Oh, that's what I'm thinking of.

200
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,620
It's been a long time.

201
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,460
- It's been a long time since that came out.

202
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,300
- Since World War II.

203
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,660
(laughing)

204
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,100
I've forgotten pretty much everything about it.

205
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,940
- You know what fucked me up?

206
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,760
- It's pretty tough.

207
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,580
- I saw the thing that said that that King Krule album,

208
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,980
"Six Feet Beneath the Moon" came out 10 years ago.

209
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,900
- I always thought that King Krule was a

210
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
- I didn't even toothpick who I should kill.

211
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,100
I never have, I never cared about him.

212
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,300
And I've cared about a lot of really stupid shit,

213
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,740
so this is not me being like, I'm a cool guy.

214
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,580
But I saw that and I felt,

215
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,180
I saw that thing you were talking about where it said,

216
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,020
this King Krule album came out however long ago,

217
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,540
I felt nothing. - 10 years.

218
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
- I felt nothing.

219
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,380
- You didn't feel a thing?

220
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,260
- I didn't even read it.

221
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
- Oh man. - Or look at the video.

222
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,180
I didn't even care 'cause I'm so cool.

223
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,620
- Yeah, that is really cool.

224
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,460
- Yeah. - Yeah.

225
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,000
Meanwhile, I find out some Magic the Gathering set

226
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,600
came out 10 years ago.

227
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,800
- I found the floor solid.

228
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,620
- Or you find out somebody makes a thing

229
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,760
that you came out 25 years ago.

230
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,480
You go, what the fuck?

231
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,320
- When your mom posts a photo.

232
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,720
- I don't even remember that.

233
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,560
- Yeah.

234
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
- Your mom posts a collage and it's a pic.

235
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
It's like, got a fucking picture of the collage

236
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,360
from the year before 'cause my mom does it.

237
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
- For sure.

238
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
- Have you seen those?

239
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,920
- Oh yeah, the collages?

240
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,120
- Yeah, the collages my mom makes for my birthday

241
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,240
where she puts the fucking other collages

242
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
from the year before into the collage.

243
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,760
So there's like 49 pictures.

244
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,600
- Collage-ception.

245
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,440
- Collage-ception.

246
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,320
- Collage-otopia.

247
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
It's kind of a gold ratio.

248
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,680
- Oh yeah, so let's talk stack-otopia.

249
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
- Yep.

250
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,400
- Or stack-topia, 'cause I, we,

251
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,340
for those who haven't seen stack-topia,

252
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,520
it was chips that were stacked.

253
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,360
- Yeah.

254
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,920
- And it was very, it was very funny to see this video again

255
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
'cause I totally forgot about it

256
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
'cause it was from a while ago.

257
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
- Oh, it's right there.

258
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,660
It's the first result.

259
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,500
- There's something to clarify.

260
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,720
- I wanted to clarify something here

261
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,520
'cause I remembered exactly how this happened

262
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,280
and it was making me laugh really hard.

263
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,640
So this is Stacktopia, if you haven't seen Stacktopia.

264
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,120
And if I remember correctly,

265
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,160
the way that Stacktopia came about

266
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,480
is I picked up this chip and I was like,

267
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
whoa, look at this.

268
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,560
And Caleb said, wow, it looks like Spanakopita.

269
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,460
And Patrick said, oh yeah, Stacktopia.

270
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,720
(laughing)

271
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,360
Patrick thought that Caleb said Stacktopia.

272
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,560
And was like, oh, yeah.

273
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,240
Yeah, by the way, people think

274
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
that we maybe stacked those chips.

275
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,320
No, no, they came out of the firelight.

276
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,720
And all of these photos are,

277
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,400
because I was trying to upload them to a 3D modeling app

278
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,120
because I wanted to make a 3D model of Stacktopia.

279
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,960
- And it didn't work out.

280
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,080
So now that you understand Stacktopia,

281
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,440
now you will go back and you'll be watching it

282
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,280
with an entire, and now it can go completely viral.

283
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,120
- Yeah.

284
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,940
- We posted this.

285
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,200
- Post the story behind Stacktopia.

286
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,040
- This happened probably.

287
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,000
- Look at that, did you see that hold?

288
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,400
- This happened probably four months ago.

289
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
- Yeah, a long time ago.

290
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,800
- Yeah, and so this is, but now is the time.

291
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,720
- And I texted you guys, I texted you guys--

292
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,800
- The world's finally ready.

293
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,560
- Three days ago, and I said,

294
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,280
do you guys remember Stacktopia?

295
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,940
and then you said no, and then I sent you this video

296
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,780
that I made.

297
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,180
- I thought you were talking about Pop Tropica first.

298
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,020
- No, I was talking about Stacktopia.

299
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,840
- It took me a minute to remember what Stacktopia was,

300
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,680
'cause I was like, that sounds so familiar, Stacktopia.

301
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,040
- And I found like 30 pictures of it.

302
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,240
(laughing)

303
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,280
- Of just a bunch of chips.

304
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,360
- It is Stacktopia.

305
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,360
- Dude, imagine that's an island.

306
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,520
What would you call it?

307
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,480
Literally nothing else you can call it.

308
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,560
- Chip island?

309
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,280
- Yeah, I think I'd be more, it would be more crazy.

310
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,400
- It would be stacked-topia. - Crazy.

311
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,360
- No, no, no, no. - No, it would be chips,

312
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
'cause there's no reason, if that was an island,

313
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,680
why would I be like, oh yeah,

314
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,240
it's chips stacked on top of each other?

315
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,560
The amazing thing is that there's an island

316
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,880
that looks like chips. - Yeah.

317
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
- Not that it looks like chips stacked.

318
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,920
- And you would still call it,

319
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,760
you guys are getting hung up on this.

320
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,560
- I would call it chip-ville.

321
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,400
- No, you would call it stacked-topia.

322
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,320
- If I was small and I lived on chip,

323
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,440
if I lived on chips already. - Yeah.

324
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,120
- I would call it-- - And then I saw,

325
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,800
if I usually lived on one chip--

326
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,640
- And then I saw that, maybe I would say--

327
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,160
- Maybe I would say, oh, Stactopia.

328
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,920
- Especially if it was like, either way,

329
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,800
there's a universe where you would call it,

330
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,640
- If I saw like a bus--

331
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
- There's only a universe that exists

332
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,120
where you will call it Stactopia.

333
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,000
- Well, I call it Stactopia in this universe,

334
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
but I don't call it Stactopia in the universe

335
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,920
where it's an island.

336
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,800
- Where there's already a Stactopia.

337
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,600
- No, in the universe I live on a chip.

338
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,440
- Oh, okay.

339
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
- Which that, you get to harvest salt.

340
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,400
- That could be a movie.

341
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,240
- Yeah.

342
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,280
- Chip, Chipman.

343
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,140
- Just a guy, just a different alternate.

344
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,200
- That could be even bigger than Star Wars.

345
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,040
A world where everybody lives on a chip.

346
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,200
- His name could be Chip,

347
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,780
and it could be called Chip on the Chip.

348
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,240
- That sucks.

349
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,080
- That's stupid.

350
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,920
- Yeah, that's more of a TV show now.

351
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,280
- Hear him out.

352
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,120
- That's more of a TV--

353
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,940
- I already heard him out.

354
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,780
This is only part of his idea.

355
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,620
- Well, that would be the TV show

356
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,920
that comes out after the movie.

357
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,760
- Or maybe, yeah, that comes out of the--

358
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,580
- Like out of Jimmy's head.

359
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,560
- Chip the Animated Series.

360
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,960
Well, Chips is already...

361
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,720
- You could call it--

362
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,800
- That's a cop show, though, right?

363
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
- Chips is already a thing.

364
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,840
- I never saw that.

365
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,480
- Me neither, but I just know the name.

366
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,040
- I know Eric Rada is in it.

367
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,120
- See, but I click on that show and I go,

368
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,840
(imitates clicking)

369
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
- Yeah, then there's no chips.

370
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
- And I go, "Ah, I thought this was about a guy

371
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,480
"who lives on a chip and he sees chips stacked

372
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,320
"and they call him Stacktopia."

373
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
- I thought this was a guy who lived on a giant chip

374
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,760
and when he got hungry he just reached down

375
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,040
and ate the ground.

376
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,720
But no, it's about two cops.

377
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,320
- It would be so hard to eat the ground

378
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,160
if you lived on a chip.

379
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,980
- Who are probably fucking racist.

380
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,820
- You'd have to have a jackhammer.

381
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,680
- It's a Stacktopia, and it's an island in a sea of salsa.

382
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,880
- I'd like to get you stuck between the stacks.

383
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,120
- The salsa C?

384
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,360
- The salsa C.

385
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
- Chip in the salsa C?

386
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,680
- Uh huh.

387
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,480
- I'd like to see him get stuck in the stacks

388
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,000
like 127 hours, have to saw his own legs off.

389
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,200
- I would eat my way out.

390
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,320
- Yeah, and it would be called four chips.

391
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
- Yeah.

392
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,360
- Instead of 127 hours.

393
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,040
- Four chips stacked on top of each other.

394
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,600
And I'm stuck between them in parentheses.

395
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,440
- And I'm small.

396
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
- And I got little.

397
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,100
- And I'm small.

398
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,940
- That's how I get stuck in the chips.

399
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,780
- By the way, I'm small.

400
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,920
- That's a perfect subtitle for a movie.

401
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,160
By the way, I'm small.

402
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
(laughing)

403
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,360
- The chip on the poster.

404
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,480
- The Chip's Adventure, by the way I'm small.

405
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,120
- 'Cause you walk up to that and it says

406
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,920
Chip's Adventure, you're like, oh it's a guy,

407
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,760
his name is Chip or something.

408
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,580
- It's about cars or something.

409
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,420
- It's a spin off of Chips.

410
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,520
- And then you get, it says, by the way I'm small,

411
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,120
you go, he's stuck in a chip.

412
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,480
(laughing)

413
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,080
Okay, all right.

414
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,600
I gotta know, he's in the chip.

415
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,100
- This is, not to get back to downsizing,

416
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,640
but this is what it should have been.

417
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,480
- Downsizing.

418
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,680
- If it had a subtitle, by the way they're small.

419
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,960
- If I directed Downsizing, you don't understand

420
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,640
fucking amazing that movie would be right because it would be because you're

421
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,760
watching what are you watching you're watching I'm wanting I shrunk the kids

422
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,360
and you're saying wait why is this a bad thing their lives just got awesome

423
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
because they can see things in a bigger new perspective right huh but the only

424
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,880
problem is they're stuck in this boring all front lawn and the house fuck yeah

425
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,160
you're going to the mall yeah you're going to the miniature really walk a

426
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,400
candy factory you're going to the toy store you're gonna go to the toy store

427
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,680
- Oh, you're fighting the toy.

428
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,800
- If I directed that movie, they would just go to a town

429
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,760
that was really small and it was exactly the same.

430
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,600
- Exactly.

431
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
- Isn't that what they do in that movie?

432
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
- I don't know. - No.

433
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,840
- They get moved into like little condos.

434
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,680
Did you see, did you see Downsizing?

435
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,840
- No, Downsizing that--

436
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,040
- We're talking about Honey Shrunk.

437
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,360
- Downsizing they went to--

438
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,200
- Honey Shrunk.

439
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,720
- Downsizing they went to a small--

440
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,000
- Honey Shrunk, I'm an oat.

441
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,840
- Do you know what I realized?

442
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,660
The Downsizing--

443
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,400
- Honey Shrunk, I'm an oat.

444
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,280
- You know what I would do though?

445
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,680
I would go-- - By the way, I'm a small--

446
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
- And by the way, I'm as small as an oat.

447
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,760
No.

448
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,680
(laughing)

449
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,680
- I live on a chip and I'm as small as an oat.

450
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,440
(laughing)

451
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Texting someone you met at a party,

452
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,160
be like, "Hey man, it was nice to meet you.

453
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,360
"I'm gonna hang out sometime."

454
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,560
By the way, I live on a chip and I'm as small as an oat.

455
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,960
(laughing)

456
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,320
- Something happened on the way to a party.

457
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
- Hey man, can you come help me out?

458
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,080
Hey, I need, just a text, I need a favor.

459
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,680
Five texts later, I live on a chip, I'm as small as an oat.

460
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,040
I don't have time to explain how it happened, but I'm oh my god. I live on a chip. I'm a small

461
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:36,160
Salsa see a smart like the smartphone thing where it's like the I screen shot from like 2011

462
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,540
Yeah, it's like it's I live on a chip and then the person says what and I'm as small as

463
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:49,840
And then they're like, wait, what do you mean? He's like, oh my god. I'm sorry. I live on a ship and I'm as small as a

464
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:58,080
a cat. Oh my God, fucking auto correct. Yeah, I live on a ship and I'm a sailor on a boat.

465
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,840
Can you imagine how long if you're texting somebody that small, how long those three

466
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,920
dots would just be sitting up as they jump from letter to letter and just try to heat

467
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,980
up their hand hot enough that it registers on the touch screen? Oh my God. I guess you

468
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,360
would have to put spaces in between each dot. Yeah, well you would send, you would jump on

469
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,280
the, you would jump on the dictation, the dictation button and then it would say it in really

470
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,800
small letters because your voice is so high pitched. Or you have to get right up in there and go

471
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:27,760
"I live on a chip and I'm as small as an oat! Period."

472
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Because you gotta have a good voice.

473
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:35,760
And all that just to communicate what you are. Not even "and I'm hungry."

474
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,760
And not how you feel.

475
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,760
"And I'm not feeling very good today! Period."

476
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,760
"I need crumbs!"

477
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,760
Shrug emoji!

478
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
No, shrug!

479
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I live on a chip.

480
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Shrug!

481
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,760
Not hug!

482
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
Not hug!

483
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,760
Shrug!

484
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,760
I live on a chip.

485
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I'm as small as an oat.

486
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,760
Small as an oat is the innovation.

487
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
Here's what I would do.

488
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,760
That's beautiful.

489
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,700
If I made a movie like Downsizing, this would be the concept, okay?

490
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,600
It's a guy, and we never get any backstory for why he's small, but he's a guy who lives

491
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,040
in our world and has to live as close to a normal life as possible while being as small

492
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
as an oat.

493
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Yeah.

494
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
job. They don't give him... There's no sorts of...

495
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
It's like Flat Stanley.

496
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah, but it's kind of like... It would be, I guess...

497
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Oat Manly.

498
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Oat Manly.

499
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,040
It would be, I guess, some sort of comment on how we don't have any... How there's not a lot of accessibility.

500
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Because it would take him probably a couple of years to get to work every day.

501
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Yeah.

502
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Or every year.

503
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Unless he rode a paper airplane.

504
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
But even... I mean, how fast does a paper airplane go?

505
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Four miles an hour?

506
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Depends. Depends on the wind.

507
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
To an oat.

508
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,040
In the city.

509
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,040
To an oat, it's a bullet train.

510
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Yeah.

511
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,400
- It's still there, it's the same speed.

512
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,240
- If you were as small as an oat--

513
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,640
- But two and it's relative.

514
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,480
- If you were as small as an oat though--

515
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,200
- You know what I think about Einsteinian discoveries?

516
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,020
- That's true.

517
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,320
- If you were as small as an oat,

518
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,120
why would you leave work at all?

519
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,800
You can just build a perfect home in your filing cabinet.

520
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,640
- Okay, what I will say,

521
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,100
so we're talking about accessibility and stuff.

522
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,360
If you're as small as an oat

523
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,280
and you're not on some type of welfare,

524
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,320
I think our government has failed.

525
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,160
- That's true.

526
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
- This guy who's the size of an oat

527
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,160
and lives on a chip should not have to work.

528
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,520
- We don't fucking pay.

529
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
We don't pay these fucking oat people.

530
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,360
That would be the whole thing.

531
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
We don't pay fucking oat people.

532
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,040
These fucking oat-sized welfare queens sitting around collecting grains.

533
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,080
He's going to Angkor to try and get housing, but yeah, he's trying to live in a real fucking

534
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
acorn.

535
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Yeah, that's right.

536
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:34,320
Well yeah, that's what, to a guy the size of an oat, a chip is a mansion.

537
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,920
They're like, these guys the size of oats are living in chips.

538
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,160
The governments are giving them money to live in chips.

539
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,640
They should be living inside of a peanut shell.

540
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,480
- Let's be real.

541
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,800
- That's how cruel the Tories are.

542
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,960
- If you're not gonna work, put 'em in a--

543
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,760
- Let's be real, the chip is more like a yacht

544
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,560
'cause it's going in the Salsa Sea.

545
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,480
- Yeah.

546
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,320
- The Salsa Sea.

547
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,840
- His house is probably like an acorn or a can.

548
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,800
Or like some kind of, maybe he's hollowed out a soda can.

549
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,320
- Elon Musk of oat people lives in a can.

550
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,160
- No way.

551
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,520
- Yeah, he lives in a can, but then all these other people

552
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,840
are living in acorns or rocks.

553
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,000
- He drives an electric ant.

554
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,920
- I would live, that doesn't make any sense.

555
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,760
- It's like an electric car.

556
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,480
- I'm not gonna do that, I'm not gonna go with that.

557
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
An electric ant?

558
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,840
- That makes sense.

559
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,760
- Design an electric ant right in front of me.

560
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,600
- Do you have paper?

561
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,420
- No.

562
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,760
- We have MS paint and we can describe it to Jubio.

563
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,400
- Just describe to me what an electric ant is right now.

564
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,680
How would that work?

565
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,680
- It's an ant with a AAA battery taped to it.

566
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,480
- I don't already, most things move from electricity.

567
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,440
- Why did you open Excel?

568
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,800
- Isn't that what muscles are?

569
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,300
its electrical impulses, right?

570
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,140
- So that's not gonna work for me.

571
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,960
- Normal ant is not.

572
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,800
- That's not gonna work for me.

573
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,640
- Okay, it's an ant.

574
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,460
- That's right, I forgot I was explaining

575
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,860
something to a second grader.

576
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,240
- I don't look like a second grader.

577
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,400
- It's an ant with a nine volt battery.

578
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,240
- You do look like a second grader.

579
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,880
He's like, "Dad, look, I dressed up."

580
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,660
- I look like an artist.

581
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,500
And you're basically jealous.

582
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,460
- You do look like a finger paint artist.

583
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,300
- Can I tell you--

584
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,120
- Macaroni artist ass.

585
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,960
- You guys are jealous because

586
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,040
I've had a long and amazing career.

587
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,880
- Yeah.

588
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,700
- I've had a long and amazing,

589
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,000
legendary, famous singer career.

590
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and I'm uh...

591
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
*laughs*

592
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hey!

593
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I think I look good, I think that this is the uniform

594
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You guys are pretty underdressed for what we're doing today by the way

595
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, I'm dressed up like a music producer

596
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
because I made my shirt

597
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I made my shirt dark

598
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
So Cam, what's your fucking excuse you piece of shit?

599
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You look terrible. He's wearing a music shirt

600
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What are you talking about?

601
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Clearly somebody has never

602
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
looked at a picture of a band or producer

603
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Have you ever heard of Rick Rubin?

604
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,440
Who the hell's Rick Rubin?

605
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
You think this guy dresses in a suit?

606
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,320
You think this guy wears sunglasses?

607
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,720
I don't think Rick Rubin fits him.

608
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,000
What's this guy, a mascot?

609
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,160
He dresses like a homeless watermelon.

610
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,200
I've actually seen Rick Rubin.

611
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,440
He looks terrible.

612
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,720
He doesn't look good.

613
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,760
All right, good music comes from people

614
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,720
who don't care enough about the world

615
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,920
to dress up and let other people like them

616
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,800
with the way they look. That is Santa.

617
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
No, that's Rick Rubin.

618
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,920
Look at this guy.

619
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,520
You think that this is the standard

620
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,900
that I'm living up to here,

621
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,920
and I would argue that I have gone above and beyond,

622
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,660
and he is the number one music producer on the universe.

623
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:07,280
- That is Santa Claus and you are lying to me.

624
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,420
- That's Baba Ram Dass.

625
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,980
- That is Radagast from the Hobbit movies.

626
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,620
- Well, but anyway.

627
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,780
- We're looking at music today.

628
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,540
- What we're doing today is we're gonna have

629
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,420
a little bit of a competition, okay?

630
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,620
We have some people.

631
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,980
- We have handpicked some celebrity stars of tomorrow.

632
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
- We have people live in the audience.

633
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,500
And a little bit, can we just talk about

634
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,100
each of our individual music careers really quickly?

635
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,820
So me, I'm a triple platinum gold artist

636
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,660
who has basically changed many different genres of music

637
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,100
and I've also invented my own instruments.

638
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,540
So that's pretty impressive.

639
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,020
- Wow, which instruments?

640
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,280
- You ever do the thing where you take a comb

641
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,860
and you put the piece of paper on top of it?

642
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,700
- Yeah.

643
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,620
- I completely invented that.

644
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,500
- Oh, that's great.

645
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,760
- My musicals thing is that for a long time

646
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,700
I had my own independent record label

647
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,020
and I signed bands called like--

648
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
business side of the thing.

649
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Ass, fucker, shit, brain.

650
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,020
This was in the 90s.

651
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,740
And gargantuan penal rocket and stuff like that.

652
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,980
But then I signed a little act called One Direction.

653
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
You signed 1D.

654
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Wow, I didn't even know that about you.

655
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,180
To my record label, which was called Motherfucka Records.

656
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,780
And then I became rich and changed my outfit and got rid of all my tattoos.

657
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,260
Wow, that's pretty cool.

658
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,980
For me, not that I really have to explain it to anyone listening, but I was a global superstar

659
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:40,740
for as many as 25, 27, 28 years before I kind of hung it up to be a TV star.

660
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,980
But back in my music career, I was working on the singing shit, but I was also kind of

661
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,420
a dancer and I was waffling in between the two, never really figuring out.

662
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,260
Also a medical doctor and a graphic designer for some years, which I did a lot of the album

663
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,260
covers on my own.

664
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
You worked on websites too?

665
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Personal websites for people?

666
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:06,900
websites, yep, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, all this type of shit. And also I was able

667
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,540
using graphic design to make my skin appear green on a lot of my albums. And I made a

668
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,700
genre called alien rock.

669
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,900
Holy shit, really? That was you?

670
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Yep.

671
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
So obviously we're very...

672
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Cameron Fetter music.

673
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,900
I think that there's almost...

674
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Follow Cameron Fetter music.

675
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,900
There's almost nobody...

676
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,580
Follow Patrick Gordon music and Kayla Pitts music on Instagram. We're trying to get our

677
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,700
followers up so that we can get...

678
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,900
And there's a picture of the instrument I played on my Alien Rock albums.

679
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,260
They're trying to get our follows up so that people will take us serious in the music industry.

680
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,260
They do take us seriously.

681
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:39,620
We don't talk about it enough, but we used to be big ass stars before we did podcasting.

682
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,980
There's a step down.

683
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,300
There's almost nobody more qualified.

684
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,980
I don't want to do this.

685
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
Me neither.

686
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,980
I don't want to do this.

687
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Of course, these microphones.

688
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
I don't want these microphones.

689
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,540
I want these microphones on the side of my face and I'm going, "I want something just

690
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,540
like this.

691
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Ooh, ooh."

692
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
That was me.

693
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,160
I wrote that song and we actually I just remember a song called. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

694
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,700
So if you've heard that

695
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,300
All this was through sensitive gangster records our IP we lost the LLC after we got it bought out by T-Mobile

696
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,740
Mmm, listen, there's which I want to say

697
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:20,220
They have been sponsoring my windscreen this whole time. Oh, yeah nice T-Mobile

698
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,860
It's clear that there's nobody more

699
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:29,300
Ready to judge people that I like music industry. Nobody has a better resume than us

700
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,700
So so we put together a little bit of a competition

701
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,000
Okay, yeah, and some if not all of these people if not one of these people is gonna get a record deal

702
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,020
Uh-huh sent to Hollywood personal trip to our apartment a personal massage from all three of us

703
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,100
Uh-huh a sandwich and we get to watch them in the jacuzzi. Yes, because it's a one-person

704
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,300
- It's a jacuzzi tub.

705
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,460
- It's a jacuzzi that we bought and we did not know

706
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,380
didn't fit in any of our apartments

707
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,220
and we had to put it in the office.

708
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,700
- And some of our bacterias and gut flora in a jar, or vial.

709
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,020
- Our first contestant, this is James Lang.

710
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,500
He's coming to us from, looks like somewhere

711
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,620
in Southern California, James Lang.

712
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,380
You wanna introduce yourself, James?

713
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,700
- Hey, Bella.

714
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,380
So I don't know if you remember this,

715
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,520
But a couple of months ago, you liked my status.

716
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,420
That's a like my status and I'll sing you a cover.

717
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:25,920
Okay.

718
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,320
I know it's long overdue, but here I am.

719
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:28,820
Interesting.

720
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,620
Real sob story with this guy right now.

721
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,960
So I'm going to attempt to do a cover of "Fact" by Eminem.

722
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,660
Oh, interesting.

723
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
I'm excited to hear that.

724
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,340
Probably do something else because,

725
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,060
I mean, if you know the song "Fact,"

726
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,400
it's pretty fucking bad, but.

727
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,900
Okay, well, I don't know why you picked that

728
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,180
for the competition then, James.

729
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,540
I can't really rap but let's see how it goes.

730
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
Alright let's see.

731
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,420
I feel like he's going to blow my mind.

732
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
He has to right?

733
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
James you there?

734
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
Alright James whenever you're ready.

735
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Whenever you're ready go ahead.

736
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
Fag.

737
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
You want to try again?

738
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:11,540
I never seen no shit like this, this bitch can twist like a damn contortionist.

739
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:16,580
Con-am-er-a-dick of course it is, this bitch don't know what abortion is so I can't come

740
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,580
in it.

741
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:37,580
*Rapping*

742
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,080
Wow

743
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:46,580
*Rapping*

744
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,320
James, incredible.

745
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
Wow.

746
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
Wow.

747
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
Oh my goodness.

748
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,320
James, that's enough James.

749
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
James, that was...

750
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
James, thank you.

751
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
That was incredible, I think.

752
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Oh wow, oh wow.

753
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
No more James.

754
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
James, you did enough buddy.

755
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
That was plenty.

756
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
That was plenty.

757
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
That really was.

758
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,320
Okay, we can just go in order, right?

759
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Yeah.

760
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
So for me, James, the thing is, baby, that was one of the best things we've seen all day.

761
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Oh, yeah.

762
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

763
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
I mean, I'm not going to lie.

768
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:16,520
The thing is, baby, that was one of the best things we've seen all day.

769
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,080
Oh, yeah.

770
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:24,440
Right? Like, that was kind of incredible. I loved the fact that you decided to go acapella,

771
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,320
no backtrack at all. We liked that a lot. We loved that. I thought the lyrics, I don't know

772
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,080
if you wrote that song or something. I love his story. Baby, I love your story. I think that

773
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,880
there's obviously a superstar in there somewhere, and maybe we're going to mine that out of you,

774
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,320
James. So for me, I'm going to say that that's going to be a yes.

775
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,160
Now for me, I'm going to go right off the, right off the bat,

776
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,560
you mentioned Bella,

777
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,600
which is I guess your song collaborating partner or something.

778
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,080
I would love to see you two work together more.

779
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:03,640
Also doing this just because somebody liked your Facebook status and then you go

780
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,120
all in like this is like, it just shows that you're ready to go.

781
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:14,040
You have a celebrity star power that I don't even think is like being done.

782
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,800
It hasn't even been realized your full potential yet, James.

783
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,320
And you have that crazy ass goatee that makes you look like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.

784
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,160
And that's honestly a fucking trademark that I can get behind for an artist.

785
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,300
So?

786
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,480
It's going to be a yes for me.

787
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:31,980
Yeah.

788
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,240
All right. So, James, love the music, buddy.

789
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,880
You look like a slob, okay?

790
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,240
You're disgusting. - Whoa!

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,880
- You have a piece of paper on your wall.

792
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,280
I don't know if you noticed that,

793
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,280
but we kind of try to present an image.

794
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,120

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,680
you're gonna have to take that down

797
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,600
before you come on our fucking show.

798
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,000
- Okay, so-- - So, well--

799
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
- James, don't listen to him.

800
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,760
He spoils for it. - And you smell horrible.

801
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,480
I can smell you from over here.

802
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,140
James, here's the thing, you're going to Hollywood.

803
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,640
Yep.

804
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,360

It doesn't really matter what he says.

811
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,240
Don't worry about him, James.

812
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,280
You are a star.

813
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,220

815
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,600
And this is coming from a grandma-nominated artist, OK?

816
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,360
I'm one of these--

817
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,280
He's grandma-nominated.

818
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,720
His grandma said he's really good.

819
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,120
But I was nominated.

820
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,760

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,360
I'm not throwing shade on the music here, guys and James.

825

You may be a grandma nominated musical artist,

826
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,740
but I don't know if you guys remember,

827
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,440
I was an Oscar nominated costume designer,

828
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,600
and your costume fucking stinks, pal.

829
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
Get some color in there.

830
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,280
- It's not about costume content.

831
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,320
- It's about the music, man.

832
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,160
- It's really not.

833
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,980
- It's about performance.

834
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,820
- It's about the fucking music, man.

835
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,640
- James, don't worry about it.

836
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,480
We're gonna go on to the next person.

837
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,320
- We'll move on, we'll move on, James.

838
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,140
- You did your thing.

839
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,980
- You did your damn thing.

840
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,820

841
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,640

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,140
- You did the thing.

845
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,600
- Okay, this is from, this looks like it's some kind

846

group the Mormonas. I don't really know much about this but go ahead y'all.

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,880
Right?

880
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,800
So you're saying you're a Moe, I bet you're a Moelester, right?

881
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,680
I bet you all got molested and that's why you're like this.

882
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,680
So stop doing covers.

883
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,880
Listen, okay, and we all know what you're- And that's going to be a no from me.

884
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,160
Hitting alcohol out of someone's hand, we all know what you're trying to do and guess

885
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,160
what guys, you will never be Earth Crisis.

886
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Never.

887
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
So you're going to want to hang it up right now.

888
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
It's unoriginal.

889
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,800
If you're trying to rip on Earth Crisis and you're saying, "I don't see a-"

890
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,840
about what you believe in. I don't have a single X on the back of your hands or anything or

891
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,680
anything like that. But this is fake punk. That's what this is. 100%. This is fake fucking

892
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:33,200
punk. These are new jacks. But you know what? It's still going to be a yes for me. Wow. Yeah,

893
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,620
it's going to be a yes for me. It's two no's. It's a hard no for me. Listen, you know that

894
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:45,300
presentation is important to me? Yeah. And this presentation was horrible. I thought the

895
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,140
- The countdown was good.

896
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,020
- Get some flashing lights and get some fog machines

897
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,580
and then maybe we'll talk, it's a no from me.

898
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,980
- Yeah, that's gonna be a no.

899
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,140
So moving on, we don't wanna see anything more

900
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,620
from the Mormonas, which I'm realizing now--

901
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,540
- I think it's Mormons in Spanish.

902
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,260
- Why would it be a different--

903
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,100
- There's Spanish subtitles at the bottom of the screen.

904
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,020
- If you went there, would your name be Petrica Patricia?

905
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:06,900
- Patricio.

906
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,460
- Patricio, not Fat Chance, buddy.

907
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,540
- Ask Jubio.

908
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,420
- This comes from Sean N, and it looks like

909
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,200
he's got a backup singer, or maybe that guy's name's Sean

910
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,960
and his is just a letter.

911
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,040
Tire Cruise Diamond Knight.

912
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,880
Diamond Knight.

913
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,160
All right, yep.

914
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,980
All right guys, go ahead.

915
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,820
Whenever you're ready.

916
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,160
(rap music)

917
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,520
Wow.

918
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:40,520
[Music]

919
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:49,520
[Music]

920
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Wow. I'm loving everything about this. They have a matching outfit.

921
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,520
The music, I'm just closing my eyes and letting the music speak for itself here.

922
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,360
- That's awesome.

923
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,700
- These are a close duo too.

924
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,540
- That's amazing.

925
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,380
- Maybe they're twin brothers.

926
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,940
- Yeah, that could be a big selling point.

927
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,020
- I feel like I know the words,

928
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,220
I just wanna sing along.

929
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
- Yeah.

930
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,040
- Whoa.

931
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,860
- Whoa.

932
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,700
- All right, I don't know.

933
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:21,960
- A little bit of a liberty there on the words.

934
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,400
- Sean and Ian, this is just not,

935
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,560
so you were on TV.

936
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,000
- You had us in the first half.

937
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,120
You had us in the first half.

938
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,220
- Yeah, you had us in the first half, not gonna lie.

939
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,720
- But by the way, this is going on network television,

940
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,160
so you can't say-- - ABC Family.

941
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,480
- We're not gonna be able to hear your beautiful voice

942
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,220
if it's covered by a bleep, do you realize that?

943
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,680
So when you say, "Mother F this, mother F that."

944
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,960
- And I get you wanna be punk,

945
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,120
I get you wanna do your Jim Morrison,

946
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,720
"We Can't Get Much Higher" on TV.

947
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,900
- It's clear that this is-- - But it's been done.

948
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,240
- This is an Elvis Costello thing you guys are doing, right?

949
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,360
You're trying to get banned from Saturday Night Live

950
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,320
or some shit. - You're doing

951
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,300
an Elvis Costello thing, you're getting drunk

952
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,500
calling like Sam Cooke the n-word or something.

953
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,740
- And listen, I like-- - That's what the story is.

954
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,060
He did that to a journalist.

955
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,740
I like provocative stuff.

956
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,020
You know me, I pushed Dee Barnes down a flight of stairs,

957
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,940
right, just because I thought it would make me like Dr. Dre.

958
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,740
Okay, turns out it just broke her orbital bone.

959
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,740
So I understand trying to be provocative, okay?

960
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,140
I've been banned from every award show that there is.

961
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,580
I'm banned from the Tonys.

962
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,820
You're banned from the Source Awards

963
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,100
and we can't get into why.

964
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:29,460
I'm banned from the Source Awards, I am.

965
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,180
I did some terrible things to Benzino, right?

966
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,540
I said some really, really weird stuff about him

967
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,500
a couple of years ago, a couple of years ago,

968
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,860
before all this, you know.

969
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,340
That's why we have to do this now.

970
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,180
Yeah.

971
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,000
That's why we have to do this,

972
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,220
that's why we're like, we used to be huge musicians

973
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,140
and then we had to go into comedy

974
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,900
and do all this fucking bullshit.

975
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,740
And we had to get into,

976
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,220
we had to pretend we care about free,

977
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,380
like I don't give a fuck about free speech, right?

978
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,220
No, shut it down.

979
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,540
But I'm so, I've said so much fucked up stuff in my life.

980
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,660
- Jokes online.

981
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:01,260
- I've said so many fucked up things in my life.

982
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,020
I can't open a restaurant.

983
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,220
That's how bad my life is now.

984
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,460
- That's why we're relegated to potty training.

985
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,660
- Yeah, exactly.

986
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,620
- So we've never talked about our former music careers.

987
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:12,100
- But here's what I've never done, guys.

988
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,300
Here's what I've never done.

989
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,420
- Say the F word in a song.

990
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
- Yep, never.

991
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,260
- Never, not one.

992
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,020
- Soiled, 'cause we know this is a cover

993
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,260
of Tyo Crew's Dynamite.

994
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,580
- And maybe I'm from a different generation.

995
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,420
- I would never soil a cover.

996
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,620
I would never soil an artist's original vision.

997
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,940
Maybe I'm from a different generation.

998
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,380
Maybe I'm from the greatest generation,

999
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,860
the 1990s, late 1990s, right?

1000
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,300
Very late 1990s for me.

1001
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,660
The last couple of years of the 1990s.

1002
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,740
Probably the last three for me.

1003
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,780
But that doesn't change the fact, right,

1004
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,700
that there's some generational gap here

1005
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,780
between you and the audience.

1006
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,260
You young kids, you're coming in saying,

1007
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,740
"Mother F this, mother F that."

1008
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,700
Buddy, who do you think's gonna look down on that politely?

1009
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,620
You think Tyo Cruz is gonna see that and say,

1010
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,220
"Hey, nice cover of my song, come on tour with me."

1011
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,460
- A lot of something about the generational thing here too.

1012
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,180
You know, you young, you Zoomers, let's call it what it is.

1013
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,700
Zoomers come in here, they say stuff like,

1014
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,980
"Mother F this, mother F that," right?

1015
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,300
Okay, you know, a lot of this generation above you,

1016
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,060
like us, a lot of us are mothers.

1017
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,500
We are fathers.

1018
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,540
And you think we look down on that kindly?

1019
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,380
To hear someone say, "F a mother?"

1020
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,620
- Disrespecting the sanctity of parenthood.

1021
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,460
- Disrespecting those who came before.

1022
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,700
- Have you guys ever considered

1023
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,580
how disgusting that phrase is?

1024
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,640
Mother F-er?

1025
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,760
- Think about your mom getting fucked.

1026
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,400
- I'm just considering it now and I'm thinking about your--

1027
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,240
- Think about it.

1028
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,060
- Think about your mom.

1029
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,560
- Think about your mom getting,

1030
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,440
imagine your mom in your head right now, right?

1031
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,080
- And she's really, really wet, too.

1032
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,200
- Wet 'cause she's getting sprayed down

1033
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,160
like by virgin coconut oil, like Kevin Gates.

1034
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,000
- Yes.

1035
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,240
- She's sprayed down with it.

1036
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,080
- She's doing--

1037
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,720
- And then your dad walks in and he's sweaty, too.

1038
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,960
And it's real dark in the room,

1039
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,520
but there's enough light coming in

1040
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,080
that all you can see is the glistening skin.

1041
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,680
- Well you can see, you know how dads get waxy penises

1042
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,640
when they get kinda, like they have sex

1043
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,980
and they walk around and their penis looks like

1044
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,360
maybe it's made out of a candle?

1045
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,260
- It looks like a sweet potato that's got a nub

1046
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,100
growing off of it.

1047
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,140
- Yeah, exactly, 'cause it's kinda somewhere

1048
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,600
between hard and soft.

1049
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,440
- Yeah.

1050
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,280
- And it's got, and it's covered in your lung.

1051
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,240
- And you the listener, and you two guys,

1052
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,360
Sean and N, think about your parents fucking, okay?

1053
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,200
- Yep.

1054
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,280
- That's gross, you would never say motherfucker.

1055
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,960
- Yeah, so leave Tyler Cruz out of this,

1056
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,000
and let's move on.

1057
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,840
It's gonna be a no from all three of us.

1058
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,660
- Triple no.

1059
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,500
- Triple no.

1060
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,320
- Triple no.

1061
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,160
- Who's up next?

1062
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,800
- Let's see, who is up next?

1063
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,240
It looks like it is, ooh, another group.

1064
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,440
This is Faux Reality.

1065
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,480
- Okay, I'm real excited.

1066
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,200
- Faux Reality with a cover of Feel Good Inc.

1067
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,080
So go ahead and show us. - It's pretty exciting for me.

1068
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,280
- And this has-- - I'm a huge Gorillaz head.

1069
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,400
- I'm really excited.

1070
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,320
(laughing)

1071
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,160
Oh, wow.

1072
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,080
- Oh, they're already nailing it.

1073
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,280
- You don't really need--

1074
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,860
(upbeat music)

1075
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Oh, wow.

1076
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Okay, this got some funk to it.

1077
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
I feel like I'm in a 007 movie.

1078
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,860
Yeah, maybe some beautiful, completely silhouette shadow women

1079
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,860
turning around, holding an AK-47 right at you.

1080
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Why is that sexy?

1081
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,860
It's all shot in a fish eye. I'm thinking this is kind of a maid video.

1082
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:08,860
So, it turns out the entire band is not auditioning, actually.

1083
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,860
It's just the rapper.

1084
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,860
So, cut to about maybe two minutes in, if you wouldn't mind.

1085
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,300
Oh wait, no, go back a little bit.

1086
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,980
Like when you first see him, that's the rapper.

1087
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Keep going.

1088
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
There you go.

1089
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
I'm excited to hear it.

1090
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
Let's hear your bars.

1091
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
I want to hear the bars, man.

1092
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
Wow.

1093
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
You got the flow, kid.

1094
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
You got the sauce.

1095
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,980
Wow, you got the flow, kid.

1096
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,980
You got the sauce!

1097
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:46,980
[Music]

1098
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Damn!

1099
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Go, go, go, go, go!

1100
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,980
Wow!

1101
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,980
See, I love, what I love about, okay, I want to point out right now.

1102
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,420
right now. He's rapping, but behind him, a lot of photos of the Beatles. So he does, like

1103
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,700
we were talking about with Sean N. They didn't respect their elders. He is respecting his

1104
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,580
elders so much. He's got all these photos of the Beatles. And what is that right there?

1105
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:16,020
Is that, who's that right next to him? Guy with the mustache? I don't know who that is,

1106
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,020
but it looks like an older guy.

1107
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,380
And we already talked about the guy's name, I already forgot because I hated him so much.

1108
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,260
But he, remember what he had on his wall? A ragged piece of paper.

1109
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
James Lang.

1110
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,760
Now what does faux reality have that James Lang doesn't have?

1111
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
American flag.

1112
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,760
Pristine, flat, shiny pieces of paper.

1113
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
This is a room with care put into it.

1114
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,760
An American flag with the Beatles in front of it, because he loves American music.

1115
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,260
Yeah, hey isn't it, hey, nice British invasion.

1116
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,260
American rock and roll.

1117
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,260
Loved British invasion by the way, but if you try it again, I will put you down like a dog in my front yard.

1118
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,260
I'm ready at the front, I'm at the borders of England.

1119
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,760
Yeah, we don't call the cops.

1120
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,720
I'm at the borders of England, and if I see you leaving

1121
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,600
Heathrow Airport with a guitar, I have a 40-millimeter grenade

1122
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,240
launcher that I'm allowed to shoot at anyone going through

1123
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,640
the airport.

1124
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,680
40-millimeter grenade.

1125
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,800
40-millimeter grenade.

1126
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,040
It's small because I only need to blow up one person.

1127
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,720
If Pink Pantheress tries to jump the pond,

1128
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,760
I'm shooting her with a crossbow like Van Helsing right out

1129
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,440
of the air.

1130
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,000
So it's going to be a yes from all three of us, I think.

1131
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,280
And we don't want to waste any more time,

1132
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,480
so let's move on to the next people.

1133
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,280
move on to who's next here? I think I'm next in terms of the tabs.

1134
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Was that your last one?

1135
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,280
Yeah, that was my last one.

1136
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,280
Alright, here's my first one here.

1137
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Who's this?

1138
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:37,780
I think it's DanStar88, he's doing a cover of I'm Osama by Doonstar.

1139
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,080
Alright, Dan, Doon, let's see what you've got.

1140
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,480
Here's a warning up top.

1141
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,680
This video was supposed to go up last Friday, September 11th.

1142
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,880
if anything seems "oh" of date, that is why.

1143
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
Oh, here we go.

1144
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Can we go hijacking?

1145
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:59,880
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

1146
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,880
what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

1147
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,880
what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

1148
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,880
what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

1149
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,880
the

1150
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,880
the

1151
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,880
the

1152
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,240
the

1153
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,240
and what they do it and i think that this would be a good idea right which is the

1154
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,800
built-up at seaport bomb tucked into my undies

1155
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,800
(Dunkey and the pilot talking over each other)

1156
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:58,660
- Really let loose though, Dune.

1157
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,500
Just yell it.

1158
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,660
Your mom's not here.

1159
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,500
Come on, Dune.

1160
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,440
- Yeah, let's stop it here.

1161
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,280
Let's stop it here.

1162
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,000
- Yeah, Dune, we're going to pause on Dune.

1163
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,840
- What?

1164
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,580
Listen, there's nothing that upsets me

1165
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:13,500
more as a musician than when someone won't just let their emotions out and scream.

1166
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah.

1167
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,500
Yeah.

1168
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,000
Dune.

1169
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,960
Give it to me.

1170
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,120
Oh, you're clicking on the other Dune video, the one that I was going to use,

1171
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,200
but decided not to. This is King Kunta Kendrick Lamar cover. That was another one

1172
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,700
that Dune posted.

1173
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,040
Yeah, that was the other one that I was going to use, but I decided Dune was

1174
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,160
shining in this one.

1175
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,660
Yeah, of course.

1176
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,160
Yeah, he was shining.

1177
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,460
That was smart. So, Dune, listen, baby.

1178
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:38,620
You're 50% of the way there, is what I'll say.

1179
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:45,220
Let me say this, you seem like a great guy. I don't know if you wrote this song or if

1180
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:50,300
this is a cover. I understand it's very conceptual. It would fit right in on any kind of concept

1181
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:57,300
album. I really like it. The reality is, like I said, you seem like a good guy. Maybe you

1182
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,940
do have a future in entertainment, but just the voice, it's not there for me. It's really

1183
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,660
just not there.

1184
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,180
I think maybe with some lessons and your use of the looper pedal...

1185
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,780
You could lose some weight.

1186
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,860
So what I'm saying is, Dune, just keep at it, you know?

1187
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:15,860
Maybe try some vocal lessons, you know?

1188
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,860
And keep trying.

1189
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,740
But this time, it's going to be a no for me.

1190
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,700
I see potential in you.

1191
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:27,180
I'm giving you a yes because I loved your use of the looper pedal and I love your kind

1192
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,100
of DIY punk ethos that you're doing.

1193
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,860
This is one of the most punk rock performances I think we've seen today.

1194
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,220
Okay, so it's one and one.

1195
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
So here's what I'd like to do.

1196
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,060
- Can we just get a tiebreaker here?

1197
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,900
- Can we get Cameron, just on Cameron, right?

1198
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,740
- Just on Cameron.

1199
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,560
- Just on Cameron.

1200
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,420
- And I'm gonna address the elephant in the room, okay?

1201
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,900
'Cause you guys, you skirted around this topic

1202
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,660
and I don't blame you for doing so,

1203
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,200
but I'm not gonna pull punches here,

1204
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,380
I'm gonna come out and say what needs to be said.

1205
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,580
You're singing a song about Osama Bin Laden,

1206
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,820
and pardon the pun here, but in 2023,

1207
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,100
that doesn't fly, pal.

1208
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,100
- Damn.

1209
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,340
- It's a no from me.

1210
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,300
- Damn, Doonster, I'm sorry.

1211
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,460
Your material was too edgy for me.

1212
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,660
Thank you so much for coming by, Dune.

1213
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,500
Thank you, Dune.

1214
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,540
Thank you so much.

1215
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,380
All right.

1216
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,200
No thank you, Dune.

1217
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,040
Just get a, yeah.

1218
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,880
You're gonna be canceled.

1219
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,700
All right.

1220
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,500
Woo, that guy sucked!

1221
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,660
He was terrible!

1222
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,020
I love that guy.

1223
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,580
I love that guy, that guy's great.

1224
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,100
He was fucking shit.

1225
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,700
Here's the next performer.

1226
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:26,980
AVGNC, I'm gonna play, hello.

1227
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,560
(upbeat music)

1228
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,540
Oh, it's sextuplets.

1229
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,100
Six identical brothers.

1230
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,580
Kind of an impressive novelty.

1231
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,340
I'm seeing doubles of brothers.

1232
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:51,580
Giving me kind of a--

1233
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,380
This is giving me--

1234
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,500
LCD sound system.

1235
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,500
Yeah, yeah.

1236
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,740
This is like that kind of indie sleaze sound

1237
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:57,660
that's on the comeback.

1238
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,740
Like, I could see this being played

1239
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,540
a lot of the downtown clubs in New York City.

1240
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:05,540
- No doubt.

1241
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,380
- All right, can I have first crack at this here?

1242
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,700
- Yeah, go ahead.

1243
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,180
- Brothers, you guys are incredible.

1244
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,940
Your voices sound great, except for,

1245
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,700
I'm sure we all notice this,

1246
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:18,060
one on the right and the bottom, you sucked.

1247
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,740
You have no place in this group.

1248
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,100
And a lot of people won't tell you that

1249
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,740
'cause you're six identical brothers,

1250
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,980
they don't wanna separate you.

1251
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,420
But you five, you gotta kick that other guy to the curb

1252
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,260
'cause he is crap.

1253
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,420
- He's a gumo, Mark.

1254
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:34,740
If you agree right now to send that brother to jail, then I'll give you a yes, otherwise

1255
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,340
it's a six no's from me.

1256
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,340
I feel the exact same way.

1257
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,540
Every single one of these 8 year olds should be in Hollywood, they should be working 70

1258
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:46,340
hour weeks in a music studio, except that one, get him back in school.

1259
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,180
Get him into a school right now.

1260
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,740
I'm giving this one, this is another yes from me.

1261
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,700
Maybe it's because I found it.

1262
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,820
But I mean, again, if we send them to Hollywood, maybe we'll start to see them shine, like

1263
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,260
doing different Motown songs or something.

1264
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,220
By the way, he just kind of exposed something about the music industry that is disgusting,

1265
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,760
which is that you said, "I want to send them there because I found them."

1266
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,240
So you want a cut.

1267
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,100
You don't know what you just revealed on live TV.

1268
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,500
You want a fucking cut.

1269
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,780
You're saying, "Go ahead, guys.

1270
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,860
Send them to Hollywood and I'll be taking my 10%."

1271
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,860
Okay, you know what?

1272
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,400
- Listen, even if I'm talking to a greedy guy like you,

1273
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,240
what's better?

1274
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,740
You're in business with these six brothers,

1275
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:31,820
what's better, you get one-seventh or one-sixth?

1276
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,240
- Let's see this next one, all right?

1277
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,880
If you don't agree with this one,

1278
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,720
let's just go on to the next one.

1279
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,340
- It's the same group?

1280
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,180
- No, it's a different group.

1281
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,080
- Okay, so that was, well, we gotta give him a yes or no.

1282
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,580
It's a no from me, it's a no from him.

1283
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,040
- It's a yes from me, but that means they don't go on.

1284
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,720
So let's check out this next one.

1285
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,940
Dr. Pepper.

1286
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,280
- Is that his name?

1287
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,680
Nice to meet you, doctor.

1288
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:51,680
Hi Dr. Pepper.

1289
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,680
Okay.

1290
00:45:52,680 --> 00:46:00,880
I guess, yeah, I guess if my name was Dr. Pepper I'd probably drink a lot of soda.

1291
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,880
Wow, warm.

1292
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:17,380
This is giving me kind of Pat the Bunny, Ramshackle Glory vibes.

1293
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,380
Very fook-fuck.

1294
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,380
Very lo-fi.

1295
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,500
Andrew Jackson G-Hug.

1296
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,340
Bandcamp.

1297
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,180
On Avery Island.

1298
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah.

1299
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,840
Neutral Moat Hotel.

1300
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:27,060
Put this thing on rate your music,

1301
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,800
it's gonna get a 4.1.

1302
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,140
(rap music)

1303
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:38,140
[Music]

1304
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:45,140
[Music]

1305
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:52,140
[Music]

1306
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:57,140
This is literally indistinguishable from a pokepunks drink.

1307
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,380
(laughter)

1308
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,220
- It does sound--

1309
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,060
- All right, let's stop it here.

1310
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,880
- James, James, James, the lyrics--

1311
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,720
- Stop it here.

1312
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,300
- It's exactly like a--

1313
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,340
- That sounds like every song I listened to in high school.

1314
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,180
- Of shitty 2012.

1315
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,180
- Literally like, yeah.

1316
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,100
(laughter)

1317
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,140
- Oh, it was King Krule all the time.

1318
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,740
- Yep, that's Archie Marshall.

1319
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,540
- That kid's name is Archie?

1320
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,740
- His name is Archie Marshall, yeah.

1321
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:22,580
- Oh, King Krule's name is Archie?

1322
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,420
- King Krule's name is Archie Marshall.

1323
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,500
- I'm not even gonna go there,

1324
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:26,620
'cause you all know what I'm thinking.

1325
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:30,900
Yeah. Well, have Archie. Archie have been Marshall from SNL.

1326
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:31,900
Yeah, true.

1327
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,900
He's a perfect combo to.

1328
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:38,000
So this one, you guys think that I'm trying to push along people that I want to cut of.

1329
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,500
I don't want to see any money from this one. I'm not going to pass this one along. This

1330
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:43,500
is no for me.

1331
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:48,860
Really? This to me is maybe the most emphatic yes of the entire day.

1332
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,860
Really?

1333
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,860
This is the first one that I would listen to.

1334
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:55,940
Stylistically? I would listen to this. There's definitely a time in my life where I would

1335
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,180
of sat in my bed and listened to this.

1336
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,380
- It's like, I still kind of can't believe

1337
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,500
how much it sounds like, like Ramshackle Glory.

1338
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,340
- Was he playing the guitar?

1339
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,460
- He just needs a slightly higher pitched voice.

1340
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,500
A voice that sounds a little more like this.

1341
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,620
- And he can still sing about Dr. Pepper, really.

1342
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:12,820
Like it doesn't really, like they have

1343
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,660
some dumb songs like that.

1344
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,500
- Well he's jacking our swag.

1345
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,540
- That's true, yeah, he can do it.

1346
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,180
- He's jacking our swag, we did the Dr. Pepper cast.

1347
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,220
- The only thing, yeah, the only thing that is missing

1348
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,220
from this kid's life to be a folk punk superstar

1349
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:25,740
is he needs to leave his family and live on a train

1350
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,220
for 10 months. He needs to pretend that he was poor.

1351
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,860
Yeah, then that's fine. This would be

1352
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,980
pretty effective folk punk. Well, I guess

1353
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:40,740
you're going to Hollywood, Dr. Pepper. No, this guy's going to

1354
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,420
Portland, Oregon. He's going to Dayton, Ohio.

1355
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,980
He's going to Richmond, Virginia. We're sending this guy to Richmond.

1356
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:52,340
You get a special case. Yeah, you don't need to go to...

1357
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,340
Hollywood wouldn't understand.

1358
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,740
Yeah, see that's why I said no, you're not going to Hollywood, bud.

1359
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,140
You're going to Richmond, you're going to Portland, Maine on a boxcar.

1360
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,140
You're going to eat nothing but saltines and sardines for two weeks.

1361
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,340
I was going to be on the Acela in a Hobo outfit.

1362
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:08,340
You're going to get fired from New London, Connecticut.

1363
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:13,340
And you're going to record a masterpiece in a blanket fort somewhere.

1364
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,940
One of the best songs, one of the best folk punk albums ever recorded.

1365
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,940
By Dr. Pepper.

1366
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,340
Alright, let's hear this next one here.

1367
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:25,420
here. Now, this is an original song by one Linda Polly.

1368
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,460
Amazing. I like it.

1369
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,460
So you're a songwriter.

1370
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:30,500
A little bit older. A little bit older than these past couple of people.

1371
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,500
This could be our Susan Boyle.

1372
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,580
Original music is one of my favorites.

1373
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,980
So wait, really quick. Stop it for just a second.

1374
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:42,580
Guys, no matter what this says or what she sounds like or how good the song is, we

1375
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,300
need to say yes, because Susan Boyle was huge for that show.

1376
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,180
OK. All right. Let's just hear it.

1377
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,060
We're just agreeing. It's going to be a yes no matter what she says.

1378
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:57,060
handshake on it. Yeah, this is a yes. Okay, Linda Paula, Lindy Polly, Linda Polly, go

1379
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:02,700
ahead and show us what you got. Okay. And it's, "What are you doing?" Linda, you gotta sing,

1380
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:06,800
baby. Linda, I can tell that you're a little nervous. Please, Linda. Right.

1381
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,380
Performed by known psychic Linda J. Polly. Oh, wow.

1382
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,500
If you want your sons wearing skirts and pantyhose

1383
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,820
With lipstick on their faces and shiny neon polished clothes

1384
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:34,740
Then vote for Hillary and she'll import the pantyhose

1385
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,100
This is a known psychic vote for who? Hillary. Oh

1386
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,100
Stop the pervert, come and stop the pervert

1387
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,100
Stop the pervert, come and stop the pervert

1388
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:52,100
Come on people, this is getting scary.

1389
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:58,100
Come on people, don't go for your real.

1390
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,100
Okay.

1391
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:06,100
If you want your children to go out there to the stars.

1392
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,100
Now, Linda, something I'm noticing that you're doing here that's a really incredible musical

1393
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:15,100
technique is you're on the piano, you're playing the exact same notes that you're singing and

1394
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,020
(laughing)

1395
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,700
Which is called harmony.

1396
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,700
A lot of professional musicians use that.

1397
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
♪ Both for normal ♪

1398
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:25,100
♪ Common both for normal ♪

1399
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,740
♪ Both for normal ♪

1400
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,580
♪ Common both for normal ♪

1401
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,180
- All right, let's stop the song here.

1402
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,780
- Linda, I mean, we already agreed

1403
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,700
that this was gonna be yes,

1404
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,260
and I was worried that this was gonna be--

1405
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:35,180
- But you were technically proficient.

1406
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:36,900
- I was a little bit,

1407
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,860
I thought this was gonna be a Susan Boyle moment,

1408
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,140
and let me tell you something.

1409
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,260
- No, this is more of like--

1410
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,060
- It was, it was, you're coming to Hollywood.

1411
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:44,900
- 100%.

1412
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,400
But this was not a Susan Boyle moment.

1413
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,860
This was like a Little Mix moment.

1414
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:49,200
No.

1415
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,300
You're coming to Hollywood.

1416
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:50,800
We're going to get you in a bikini.

1417
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,260
We're doing 50 different surgeries on you, Linda.

1418
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,100
And we're going to just put you everywhere.

1419
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,380
You're going to be on billboards.

1420
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,340
Let me tell you, your musical proficiency,

1421
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,740
your technical skill is so incredible.

1422
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,580
I think that while you're doing great in this singer, songwriter,

1423
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:06,420
piano stuff, I think that you would be right at home

1424
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,420
in a band like Meshuggah or Slayer.

1425
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:08,940
Could be.

1426
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,460
I think you could really hit those strings quick.

1427
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:14,460
Also, you do kind of look like a Chuck E. Cheese animatronic.

1428
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,540
So in the interim, you know, while you're trying to grind,

1429
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,800
you could kind of play-- that could be like your-- what's

1430
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,900
that club the Beatles played at in Germany forever?

1431
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:24,500
And that's how they got good?

1432
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,260
The Cobra Club.

1433
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:28,100
That's-- you could be-- that could be your club like that.

1434
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,260
You could really hone your skill, sharpen your knife,

1435
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,260
sharpen your tools.

1436
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,620
So that's a yes from all three of us.

1437
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,220
That's going to be a yes from all three of us, Linda.

1438
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:35,260
Huge yes.

1439
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:37,300
All right, let's go to this next performer here.

1440
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,260
You're an amazing artist.

1441
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,620
This is Ass on Fire.

1442
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,980
That's his name?

1443
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,940
I forget his name.

1444
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:45,340
- Ass is on fire video.

1445
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,660
- Is this based on, is this a-

1446
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,540
- By Dance B, but Dane B.

1447
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,380
- Dainy B.

1448
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,540
- Dainy B. - Dainy B.

1449
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,580
- Okay, Danny, right off the bat, I like your style.

1450
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,660
- Ow, ow.

1451
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,260
Somebody call a fire department.

1452
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,740
- It burns.

1453
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,620
- What burns? - Smokin' hot.

1454
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:04,780
- What's smokin' hot, Danny?

1455
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:05,620
Just tell us.

1456
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,220
- Ass is on fire.

1457
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,420
Burned down to the wire.

1458
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,300
- You have a wire in your ass?

1459
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,580
- Can't catch the fire.

1460
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,060
Oh man, baby, my ass is on fire.

1461
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,980
Burning, burning and melting.

1462
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,740
Oh, what a mess.

1463
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,580
- Dr. E.

1464
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,420
- Please make a stop.

1465
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,020
Ow, ow.

1466
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,860
- Same dance.

1467
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,680
- My ass is on fire.

1468
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:25,520
- Great dance.

1469
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,620
- Feel it, please baby, help me.

1470
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,900
- Okay, I like this dance.

1471
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,420
- Yeah, this is a good dance.

1472
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,940
This could be the next viral dance.

1473
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,180
- Yeah, this is a new TikTok dance right there.

1474
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,380
- Cheeks are red, can't go to bed.

1475
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,740
Can you hear that sound?

1476
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,740
Got to jump around.

1477
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,740
Ow.

1478
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:44,740
Ow.

1479
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:45,740
Ass is on fire.

1480
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:50,740
Turn down to the wire.

1481
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,740
Down to the wire.

1482
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:53,740
Burnin'.

1483
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,740
Smolderin'.

1484
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,740
Smolderin'.

1485
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,740
Smolderin'.

1486
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,740
Heat is on.

1487
00:53:58,740 --> 00:53:59,740
Heat is on.

1488
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,740
Turn the heat off.

1489
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,740
Your ass is on fire.

1490
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:02,740
Hey.

1491
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,740
Peaks are red.

1492
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:05,740
Looking behind him.

1493
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,740
Someone's watching him dance.

1494
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,740
My ass is on fire.

1495
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,740
Burnin' and burnin' meltin'

1496
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,740
Is the camera doing this or is he having a trap?

1497
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,740
I think maybe they were stabilizing it

1498
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,740
I think they were stabilizing it on his head

1499
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:19,740
The thing is if he stabilizes it he doesn't do a great job

1500
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,740
Move the video a little bit forward

1501
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:23,740
Please help me

1502
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,740
I just want to show you that

1503
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,740
Oh ok

1504
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,740
He can be Dr. Evil

1505
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:29,740
Oh my god

1506
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,740
Flava Flav

1507
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,740
And I think he also becomes Austin Powers at one point

1508
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,740
Oh shit

1509
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:42,740
I don't know what that is. That is like... That's Elvis!

1510
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,740
Alright, yeah, that's enough Danny.

1511
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,740
Danny, please, you're done.

1512
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,740
Danny, stop! You're golden.

1513
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:53,740
What I'll say is, when I saw the name of this video,

1514
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,740
I thought that maybe it might be a cover of the Mr. Bungle song,

1515
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:02,740
"My Ass Is On Fire", and while it's not, it's pretty much, it might as well be.

1516
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:05,180
(laughing)

1517
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,500
- Danny, this was amazing.

1518
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,580
I really think you're talented.

1519
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,860
- And also, by the way, something fresh, something new.

1520
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,700
- We have costumes.

1521
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,820
- You know you have the costumes, Scott.

1522
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,700
You knew I was gonna, I had my finger in the air.

1523
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,260
You know I was like, "And the costumes."

1524
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:18,080
That's me.

1525
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,920
I'm a costumes nerd.

1526
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,700
- The showmanship, the pageantry, Danny.

1527
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,360
- The legendary.

1528
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,180
- The pageantry was incredible.

1529
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,420
And I think that that shows a real star power.

1530
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,220
So it's gonna be a yes from me.

1531
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,340
- It's gonna be a yes from me, too.

1532
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,540
- It's gonna be a double, quadruple, triple yes from me.

1533
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,840
Wow. You're going to Hollywood, Danny.

1534
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,540
You're going to Hollywood.

1535
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:34,240
Eyes on the side.

1536
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,340
You're definitely going to Hollywood.

1537
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,240
Now, let's check out this next one here.

1538
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,040
How many people you got?

1539
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,740
Yeah, come on.

1540
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,840
No, we got to skip these last ones.

1541
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,040
Yeah, this one, no.

1542
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,440
This is not, yeah.

1543
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,340
This isn't a song.

1544
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,140
We're done.

1545
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,040
Wait, just click one more.

1546
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,940
I think there's another one.

1547
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:49,040
You have, you've, you've had enough.

1548
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,840
Let's just hear this guy out.

1549
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:51,840
You just want your pay, your pay cut.

1550
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:55,540
You want, you're going to get a pay cut.

1551
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,640
Hollywood.

1552
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,840
Next.

1553
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,740
Going to Hollywood.

1554
00:55:58,740 --> 00:55:59,640
Going to Hollywood.

1555
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,240
Can you do it again?

1556
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,340
Can you perform that again?

1557
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,340
I need to hear that one more time. I just want to see if we can do that on command.

1558
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Or if it was just a fluke.

1559
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:07,340
(Whistle)

1560
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,340
(Whistle)

1561
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,340
Hollywood.

1562
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,340
Wait, wait. Okay, I like the R2 scream guy.

1563
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,340
What was that amazing, beautiful,

1564
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,340
angelic sound at the end? Uh-huh. The cameraman?

1565
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Play it one more time. Wait, the cameraman,

1566
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,340
we need the cameraman to go to Hollywood with you.

1567
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,340
I played it on .25 speed. Both of you,

1568
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:25,340
I only take you as a combo.

1569
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,340
Let's hear this in 2.5.

1570
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,340
(Whistle)

1571
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,080
(angels singing)

1572
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:32,920
- Wow.

1573
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,280
Now listen to this.

1574
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,040
(laughing)

1575
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,420
Now that is the voice of an angel.

1576
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,220
That is the voice of, okay, so now the contestants

1577
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,060
and camera has chosen.

1578
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,020
- Guys, can I bring my contestants in the stage yet?

1579
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,540
- Yes, I wanna see them, I wanna see them.

1580
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,300
These are the people I'm the most excited about.

1581
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,140
- All right.

1582
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:51,980
- See, why did you--

1583
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,020
- We don't have to worry about the slide

1584
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:54,160
and we can move forward.

1585
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,000
- Okay.

1586
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,940
- This is a song called Getting Dizzy, original song,

1587
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,860
It's by Brandon Quaight, who is a young musical prodigy.

1588
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,360
Okay.

1589
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:01,200
So just go to the next slide.

1590
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,260
I put title slides and song slides.

1591
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:03,940
So go ahead and play this.

1592
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:04,440
Let's hear this.

1593
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:04,940
Wow.

1594
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,780
That Love Is Album cover, by the way.

1595
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:07,500
Yeah, that's a great album cover.

1596
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,180
Yeah, me too. It was amazing.

1597
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,720
What did you...

1598
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,540
UBEO cannot click anything.

1599
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:12,040
You can't click.

1600
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:12,540
There we go.

1601
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:13,040
Okay.

1602
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,540
Now play.

1603
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:16,120
(upbeat music)

1604
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,820
- Okay.

1605
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:21,400
(upbeat music)

1606
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:28,700
- This way.

1607
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,280
(upbeat music)

1608
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:38,540
- Is that Brandon or is that still?

1609
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:39,780
- That's Brandon Quaid singing.

1610
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:42,360
(upbeat music)

1611
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,580
All right, Brandon. Okay, Brandon, you can stop.

1612
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,580
Yeah, that's enough, Brandon.

1613
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,780
Brandon, this is, you are, no, you don't have to go forward, Brandon.

1614
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,780
Yeah.

1615
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,780
You can stop. Brandon.

1616
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:56,060
Play the very end. Play the very end, Brandon. Just play the end of your song.

1617
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,060
Wow.

1618
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,060
What a finale.

1619
00:57:58,060 --> 00:57:59,060
Brandon, you are a Hollywood bound buddy.

1620
00:57:59,060 --> 00:57:59,900
Wow.

1621
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,640
(game show music)

1622
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,700
Brandon.

1623
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,520
What a finale.

1624
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,120
Brandon, you are a Hollywood bound buddy.

1625
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,500
Listen, it doesn't matter if we were here,

1626
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,420
you'd be going to Hollywood.

1627
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,700
No, I feel like you're already there.

1628
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,500
I feel like you're already in Hollywood writing

1629
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,340
100% of the greatest songs I've ever heard.

1630
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:20,920
I almost am suspicious of you

1631
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,980
and think you might be an industry plant.

1632
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:23,820
Yeah.

1633
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:24,640
That's what I think.

1634
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,480
He could be.

1635
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:26,300
He's talented.

1636
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,300
I think your song, Getting Dizzy,

1637
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,900
literally made me feel like I was getting it.

1638
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:31,900
- And you were a talented artist as well.

1639
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,740
- Mm-hmm.

1640
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,740
- I mean, visual artist.

1641
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:35,740
- Visual artist, yeah.

1642
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:36,980
- You got the whole package, kid.

1643
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,820
- Brandon, you're going to Hollywood.

1644
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:38,780
- It's three yeses.

1645
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,860
- Let's see this next one.

1646
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:42,100
- All right, let's check out the next one.

1647
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:44,580
This is called Christmas Day, and it's by James Woodland.

1648
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,400
- Okay.

1649
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,240
- It's kind of a holiday song.

1650
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,500
- Wow, I like your look.

1651
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,260
Already a superstar look, James.

1652
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:51,180
- Oh my God.

1653
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:53,220
- And he has video editing skills.

1654
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,980
- Look at that fucking edit.

1655
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,060
That is one of the most incredible things I've ever seen.

1656
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:59,060
A lot of people would pay millions for it.

1657
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,060
Just wait till you hear his voice.

1658
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:03,060
Yeah, we need to hear it too.

1659
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,060
The visuals are only half the battle.

1660
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:12,060
It's that one tradition that brings joy to the people, bring them together.

1661
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:21,060
Whatever happens in their lives, their kids are us, they shine so bright, Santa can't

1662
00:59:21,060 --> 00:59:23,060
see it through the night.

1663
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:29,060
Mommy's baking Christmas cookies, Daddy's working on this beautiful crib.

1664
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:31,960
Because it's Christmas Day now.

1665
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,760
Because it's Christmas Day now.

1666
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:40,260
Because it's Christmas Day.

1667
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:43,060
Because it's Christmas Day now.

1668
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:45,860
Because it's Christmas Day now.

1669
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:51,860
Because it's Christmas Day.

1670
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,660
Wow.

1671
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:56,260
Caleb is crying.

1672
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,260
Alright, you can stop.

1673
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,260
You can, James.

1674
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:06,260
Caleb thinks it's the most beautiful song he's ever heard in the world.

1675
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:10,260
Cameron, you have just found nothing but stars so far.

1676
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,260
This guy, he and, yeah, I don't even...

1677
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:14,260
James.

1678
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,260
Can I tell you guys something?

1679
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,260
Yeah.

1680
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:18,260
So, obviously, I pre-screened this guy.

1681
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,260
Yeah.

1682
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:21,260
And this is 100% real. I found this guy yesterday.

1683
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,260
This song has been completely stuck in my head.

1684
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:25,260
How can it not be?

1685
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,380
hard not to be singing it when I came into the office this morning, so I

1686
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:31,980
wouldn't spoil it, but for 24 hours straight I've been singing to myself

1687
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:37,100
"Because it's Christmas Day now, because it's Christmas Day now."

1688
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:37,600
Wow.

1689
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,600
Something else, really something else.

1690
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:41,600
James, that was really, it was incredible.

1691
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,600
That reminded me of Christmas Day.

1692
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,100
Yeah.

1693
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:44,600
I, I...

1694
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,600
Mom's baking Christmas cookies.

1695
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,300
I'm kind of at a loss of words. It reminded me of when my mom would bake a

1696
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,600
Christmas cookie and I would come downstairs...

1697
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,760
building a crib, a beautiful crib.

1698
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,600
- Like there's just--

1699
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,920
- I literally, if I ever have a kid,

1700
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,640
I will have a beautiful crib for my kid.

1701
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,240
- There's so much history and--

1702
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,560
- Because of this song.

1703
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,100
- There's so much heart in what you sang,

1704
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,000
so it's gonna be a yes.

1705
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,080
But I can't even look at you anymore.

1706
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,760
You're really getting very emotional.

1707
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,480
- Hey, so we got two yeses so far?

1708
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,320
- Yeah.

1709
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,000
- James, for me, it's not gonna be a yes.

1710
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,840
- What?

1711
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,480
- It's gonna be a Merry Christmas.

1712
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,000
- Oh my God. - Oh my God.

1713
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,960
- Buddy, you're going to the North Pole.

1714
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,800
- Yep.

1715
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,360
- James, it's a yes.

1716
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:30,360
very

1717
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,840
uh... right

1718
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,840
this is a lot of letter rock parody by digital skills and enroll this year this

1719
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:43,840
one

1720
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,040
already off to a very promising start this one

1721
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:51,680
I see McCain and that chick who has no brain

1722
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,440
Tryna win the big one but they can't do it

1723
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,880
Because there is this guy who's much cooler

1724
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,080
He's too fly and he said yes we can

1725
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:05,000
Yes we can, yes we can

1726
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:12,000
He was just a boy from Illinois

1727
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:22,000
The White House he'll enjoy.

1728
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Because this guy's too fly, he brings the wind, George Bush.

1729
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Goodbye, his famous grin, in case you forgot.

1730
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,000
I must now remind you, vote for Rock.

1731
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Vote for Rock.

1732
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Vote for Rock.

1733
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Now skip to the rap.

1734
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Skip to the rap.

1735
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Vote for Payton, she be-

1736
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Obama wins, he's Barack, he's on top, canes a flop

1737
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I, his famous grin, in case you forgot

1738
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
I, must now remind you, vote for Barack, vote for Barack, vote for Barack

1739
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yeah, yeah!

1740
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Obama wins, he's Barack, he's on top, canes a flop

1741
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
He's gonna go 'til four you stop, he gives us speeches just for us

1742
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,240
Barack, we the people, Barack, must stand together.

1743
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,280
Barack, God bless these states, God bless the world,

1744
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,280
and America, he's here and he won't get to ride.

1745
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,720
- Okay, stop it, enough.

1746
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:22,920
Buddy, you're going, I mean, the music with a message.

1747
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,080
- You have an amazing ear, Cameron,

1748
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,760
because you are picking some amazing,

1749
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:27,720
amazingly talented people. - You are picking nothing

1750
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,840
but winners.

1751
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,800
- This is a yes, I got emotional at the beginning

1752
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:32,520
just remembering the election, right?

1753
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,800
Because elections are so contentious

1754
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,360
and I hate when America fights.

1755
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:36,440
It makes me really sad.

1756
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,940
And this reminded me of Barack Obama for some reason.

1757
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,120
And his famous grin.

1758
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,360
Yeah.

1759
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,840
When I heard the word famous grin,

1760
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,040
I was like, this has to be about Barack Obama.

1761
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,160
That's one of the main things about Barack Obama.

1762
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,160
We all would say his famous grin.

1763
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,800
His famous grin, right, his grin.

1764
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:51,880
That's the beauty of music.

1765
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:52,840
Look at that grin!

1766
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,040
That's the beauty.

1767
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,280
Look at that grin!

1768
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,540
That is the beauty of music.

1769
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,820
That's the beauty of songwriting,

1770
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:00,720
is that I got a completely different message.

1771
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,800
I didn't get any of that.

1772
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,800
What did you get?

1773
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:04,960
It was about love,

1774
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,000
and I mean it was like a whole story almost.

1775
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,520
- God bless the world and America.

1776
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,520
- Yeah, so those are like names.

1777
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:10,680
- God bless these states.

1778
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:11,840
God bless the world and America.

1779
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:13,800
- So, thank you so much.

1780
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,300
Next contestant please, 'cause that was incredible.

1781
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:18,920
- Okay, this is the one I'm most excited about, I think.

1782
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,320
- Okay, we can probably end on this, yeah?

1783
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,640
- No, I have one more after this.

1784
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:22,760
That's important.

1785
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,760
Okay, we'll say this is the one I'm second most excited about.

1786
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,680
This is Mr. Silver, "Move Out the Way,"

1787
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:31,160
feat. Lil' Rocket and BK the Rapper.

1788
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,380
And the music speaks for itself,

1789
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,840
but if you aren't watching on video,

1790
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,220

01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,280
He's doing the gangnam style dance.

1800

I don't play AA so move out the way, move out the way.

I'm ready to rock, ready to rock.

1806

I'm ready to rock, ready to rock.

1807
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,280
I'm ready to rock, ready to rock.

1808
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:58,280
By the way

1809
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,280

Ready to crash cause I'm going so fast

Driving like a boss, 'bout to hit the notch

1813
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:09,880
There's about a beat, so much sauce

1814
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:13,380
Cause my engine's revving, so loud you can hear it from heaven

1815
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:18,080
So move out the way, move out the way, move out the way

1816
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,680
Before I have to remove you, or even excuse you

1817
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,680
And I'm going nitro, like the car's almost on fire

1818
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,080
So don't test me, cause you can't mess with me

1819
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:29,320
(laughing)

1820
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:33,320
- Incredible music video, I think.

1821
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,160
- Wow.

1822
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,720

- All right, that's enough, I've heard enough.

1834
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,720
- You have just found nothing but heat.

1835
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,320
- Okay, camera, you can start.

1836
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:01,840
Camera, go ahead, you can start.

1837
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,960
- These kids have fucking got it, man.

1838
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,480
This next generation is all right.

1839
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,680
I thought that they were wrong.

1840
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,000
They're kicking out jams like Move Out the Way

1841
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,560
with a music video already funded and filmed.

1842
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,600
They're not even signed.

1843
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,720
- This literally, it sounds exactly like Lil Peep.

1844
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,040
- It sounds like it's coming from heaven.

1845
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:24,480
- Yeah, it sounds like Lil Peep came down from heaven

1846
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,320
and blessed these two souls.

1847
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,080
- Mr. Silver, Lil' Rocket about to blast off,

1848
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,920
and BK the Rapper, who I don't think

1849
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,200
says anything in the song?

1850
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,120
- He has not said a single thing.

1851
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:35,420
- I'll say this, these kids are talented,

1852
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,640
there's no question there.

1853
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,300
- Right, so here's my problem.

1854
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,380
Rap is terrible.

1855
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,280
Rap is awful.

1856
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,840
Rap is fucking disgusting.

1857
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,680
- Okay, what about the last song?

1858
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,520
- What about the song Prior?

1859
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:51,340
- 'Cause here's what I hear,

1860
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,100
if these lyrics are written down,

1861
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,880
I might be able to go, oh wow, this is an amazing message,

1862
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,580
The kids could relate to this, right?

1863
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,520
Here's what I hear.

1864
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,200
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1865
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:03,520
And I think especially kids could relate to this one.

1866
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,080
Maybe.

1867
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,580
Yeah.

1868
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,560
Maybe.

1869
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,560
But I wouldn't fucking know, because I

1870
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:08,960
can't understand a goddamn word that's

1871
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,880
coming out of their mouths.

1872
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:10,200
No.

1873
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,360
So for me, it's going to be a no.

1874
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,760
You already got two, so it doesn't matter.

1875
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:15,680
But I just want you to know, next round, I'm coming for you.

1876
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,320
All right.

1877
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:17,160
All right.

1878
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:19,440
Now, this next one I have is the last one.

1879
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,440
This is the one I am most excited about.

1880
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,200
It's a cover of Grenade by Dr. Dazzle.

1881
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:24,700
OK.

1882
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,900
I think this guy has real star power.

1883
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:28,700
I think that we could get Dr. Dazzle and Dr. Pepper together.

1884
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,900
That's a good idea.

1885
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,700
So just go ahead and play this real quick, the cover of Grenade by Dr. Dazzle.

1886
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:39,700
Grenade by who?

1887
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:42,700
Just watch it and find out.

1888
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:45,700
Oh, okay. Now I hear it.

1889
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,700
*music*

1890
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,700
I catch a grenade

1891
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,700
*music*

1892
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,700
*music*

1893
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,700
*music*

1894
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:57,700
*music*

1895
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,700
*music*

1896
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
*music*

1897
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,700
*music*

1898
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,700
*music*

1899
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:07,700
*music*

1900
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,700
*music*

1901
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,700
*music*

1902
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,700
*music*

1903
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:20,700
(Music)

1904
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:27,700
(Laughter)

1905
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:30,700
(Laughter)

1906
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,700
So is Dr. Dazzle going to Hollywood?

1907
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,700
(Laughter)

1908
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,700
Um, uh, yes.

1909
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,700
(Laughter)

1910
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,700
Dr. Dazzle is...

1911
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,960
(laughing)

Wow.

I thought it was gonna be three of that in a row

1916
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,140
to be honest.

01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:53,980

1918
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:55,860
- I thought that was a layup.

01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:57,460
Put yourself in it.

01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,260
- Who filmed it for you?

1928
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:16,100
