1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[Laughter]

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
[Music]

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're a crap monster.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
[Laughter]

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
[Explosion]

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hot story tonight.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The amount of turds and farts in London has gone down.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's good.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We used to have over one million farts and a billion turds.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, this is good news. Wow.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's bad news.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's bad news.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We used to love turds.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm Nicholas Cannon with BBC One.

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,760
one we used to have 1 billion forts and 1 million turds Londoners take to the

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,160
streets to complain. Forts used to be up in the billions and the turds used to be

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,240
in the millions. There's far less forts than there used to be. Well you see Boris

20
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,000
got in the office and he can't go to can't even go down his shop buy a bird's

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
turd you can't even do that. You used to be able to go buy a woman's shit in a

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,120
store. Yeah, no you can't even smell a woman's fart on the street. You're not even allowed

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,000
to go under a woman's pants and smell a fart anymore. And you can't even follow them into

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,120
the bathroom. Nowadays with all this Me Too, you can't even smell a fart. And I'm in the

25
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:18,680
Beatles. And I'm Ringo. And I'm Ringo Starr. And I'm Paul. And I'm John. You can't even

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,040
write an album about a woman's fart anymore. You can't even make a beautiful album about

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,840
a woman's fault anymore. It's bloody mental isn't it? You can't even, we get in a studio we get

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,980
we got the bass lines coming in his song song is "I wanna eat your tits" and then

29
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,320
they shut off the recorders they say get out. They won't let me play the bass

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,760
they won't even let me play the bass. They say it sounds too much like a fart. I have a fart pedal.

31
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:47,600
I have a fart pedal that makes my bass sound like a fart. I tune my bass down real low.

32
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,440
lonely fought Clubband. Sergeant Poopers. Sergeant Poopers smelly fought Clubband.

33
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:04,600
Sergeant Poopers. Sergeant Poopers smelly fought Clubband. Club hand covered in poo.

34
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,800
Club hand covered in poo. Those Beatles actually they were addicted to shit and

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,000
boo-boo. Yeah. Yeah. Where was Buddy Mental we would go down to the

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,600
We used to make songs about TT and Far Far. Can't do that anymore.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,960
TT and Far Far.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,960
I used to go make BBs and Boo Boos.

39
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,840
And make a- and write a song about it.

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,040
Ringo went boom boom.

41
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,600
Ringo went boom boom in his underwear. In his unders.

42
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,400
His trousers.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,200
In his trousers.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,520
His trousers were running.

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
We were in Madison Square Garden.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,160
We were playing Shea Stadium. He shat- he shat his pants.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
He was supposed to play the drum like boom boom.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,880
He made a booty.

49
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,640
They replaced his uh- they replaced his old stool.

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,360
They replaced his stool with a toilet and he went out there on a field

51
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,640
He went out there on a field and he played the drums on the toilet and people thought

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,560
This is mental. People thought it was mental

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,240
And when Joey got shot

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,360
Maxwell's brown hammer

55
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,920
Fuck you Maxwell

56
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,360
Far too Maxwell. Maxwell's poop. Maxwell smells good. He like poop

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,760
Yeah if you play the Beatles

58
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,660
You play the Beatles backwards they say, "I like to smell poop. Poop is a good smell to me."

59
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,160
That's not the forwards too.

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,160
The thing is, the forwards it says, "Poop smell good, aye."

61
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,360
Poop smell good, aye.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,060
Poop smell good, aye.

63
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,760
Yeah, it's backwards, it says, "I good smell poop."

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,960
We didn't even do drugs. We would just sit around, we'd give each other pink eye.

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
It was called janken.

66
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,060
We'd get high on getting each other pink eye.

67
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,660
It was called janken that we used to...

68
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,760
We'd use red eyes all the time. That's why people thought we were smoking marijuana.

69
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,860
You put it in a balloon and you inhale it.

70
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,760
And that's what I did.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,960
You put janken in a balloon?

72
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,960
You put in a balloon and then the fumes go into the balloon and it circulates.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,460
We flew using a balloon.

74
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,160
[Laughter]

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,960
We used to have wings.

76
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,160
We used to go on tours.

77
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,960
We used to fly.

78
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,960
I used to have another eye.

79
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,360
[Laughter]

80
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,760
We used to hang out with this bloke.

81
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
I used to have wheels.

82
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,460
Flying purple people leader.

83
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,560
I used to be a robot, innit?

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,560
One-eyed, one-armed, flying purple people leader.

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,760
You don't even get me started on him.

86
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,160
He had one eye, one horn.

87
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
He was eating people.

88
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,960
He was eating people, he was.

89
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,460
What colour was he?

90
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,960
He was purple.

91
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,460
Purple.

92
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,960
Purple.

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,460
He was purple.

94
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,960
He was purple.

95
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I was purple eating people.

96
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,960
I used to be one inch tall.

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,960
Before I was born.

98
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I was one inch and then

99
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,960
after a couple of weeks I was one foot

100
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,960
tall. I was born a dog.

101
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,960
They raised me. I was a dog

102
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
raised by humans.

103
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
And I used to sniff farts.

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
And I used to sniff farts and they

105
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,960
started getting rid of farts in London.

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,960
We used to have a billion

107
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
farts. We used to have a billion farts

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
and one million. We used to have a billion

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,160
forts now there's barely one you can't even go to the shops anymore you can't

110
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,400
even go to the shops anymore and boy a fart these masks they have us wearing

111
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,960
I can't even smell them I can't even smell a fart that is true you can't like if you're if

112
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,360
you're a guy who jacks off to the smell of stinky women on the street you got

113
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,720
like you're a stinky wimpy winkies you got seriously like you're here you're

114
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,360
- Your schnoz got dirty.

115
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,720
- If you're a stinky winker winking at stinkies.

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
- If you make your--

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,760
- If you're plinking your winker to stinkies on the street.

118
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,160
- If you make your dipsy go la la to stinky winkies.

119
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,280
- Absolutely, yeah, until you make po.

120
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,760
- Did you guys ever figure out where this lyric was from

121
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,400
that I remembered?

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,880
The lyric I sent you guys.

123
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
- No.

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,540
- The rap lyric.

125
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,380
- Oh, I thought you wrote that.

126
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,380
- No, I'm trying to remember where it's from.

127
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,220
If anybody--

128
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,880
- I thought you made that up.

129
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
Can you just say the line?

130
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,880
If anyone knows where it's from, let me know. Hold on. It's like in my brain it's like a

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,360
British voice. It's like, "I just had a chat with a rat and a cat and then I became black

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,200
with a backwoods hat." Does anyone know where that's from?

133
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,080
I think that's skeptic. "I just had a chat with a rat and a cat and

134
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,120
then I became black with a backwoods hat." That's got to be from a real song.

135
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
I think that's a real drill song.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,960
I just had a chat with a rat and a cat and then I became black with the back of a tat.

137
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Well maybe we can figure it out what are the ad libs in between it because that what's

138
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,200
the what's like the hype man saying.

139
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,080
I think he says black four times.

140
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Yeah.

141
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,280
I just had a chat black.

142
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,280
Yeah.

143
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,720
With a rat and a cat black and then I became black.

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,200
Oh it's from cat rat chat.

145
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Oh shit.

146
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,880
That's a Tim Westwood freestyle I just remembered.

147
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,200
What does he mean by I became black?

148
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
Like the British one?

149
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
I don't know.

150
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,560
Rehab by Amy Winehouse she says yes I've been black.

151
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,200
What? Does she?

152
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,440
Well I don't think so because the next line is with a backwards hat.

153
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
In Rehab by Amy Winehouse?

154
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,960
I became black with a backwards hat.

155
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,080
Yeah.

156
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,280
Yeah, whatever happened to her?

157
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,040
She hasn't been making music lately. She died on my birthday.

158
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:04,800
best gift ever I like the Justin Bieber my generation sucks I think yeah great

160
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,320
say about people who don't know how to write a damn song to save their lives

161
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,480
we've you heard her cover of Valerie a cover yeah she doesn't know how to write

162
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,160
a song but you're actually her so she only can write songs about drugs and and

163
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,600
gangs and and sex what yeah yeah that's what rehabs about yeah I thought she was

164
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,000
going to like occupational therapy no that she was doing I thought she was

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,720
learning relearning how to walk after a broken leg you think she had a spinal

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,920

the toe turned black.

169
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,400
She had to relearn to walk. I had to go to rehab because my toe turned black.

170
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,040
That's what happens if you get frostbite. Remember that fucking Mr. Deeds?

206
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,480
So if anyone... that was a little example. If anybody wants to pay us money...

207
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,960
Me and Caleb are offering coaching services on saying things.

208
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,480
I just get really shy when I'm announcing things. See we're doing a king speech right now.

209
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,480
That's why we started the episode British. I never saw that movie. It looked kind of stupid.

210
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,360
Also, I don't want to muddy my image of the king.

211
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,860
True.

212
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,400
It's like the king is a strong man.

213
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,240
Whoa.

214
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,280
You're the cardboard king.

215
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,880
See, and that was the actual thing I wanted to talk about.

216
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
You're in a cardboard castle like Watsky right now.

217
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
We finally all went to the Hollywood Burger King.

218
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,480
Yep.

219
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
It's a big day for us.

220
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,960
I had a sandwich that tried to kill me.

221
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,560
Yep, he ate a chicken.

222
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
I had a wapow.

223
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,800
Wapow, impossible.

224
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
Impossible wapow.

225
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
No, I had a normal, I had a possible Whopper.

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Oh, was it?

227
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,080
I was a possible Whopper.

228
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,280
Oh, because they cross out when you get a normal Whopper, they cross out the M on the wrapper.

229
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,960
Yep, possible Whopper.

230
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,200
I genuinely thought you got an impossible Whopper because of the wrapper.

231
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
I don't want to eat the impossible meat. It's too, I think it will give me cancer.

232
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
And I've eaten so much of it.

233
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,760
I have hepatitis, so I can't eat cancer on top of that.

234
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh yeah, Caleb got, when we were at the Hollywood Burger King,

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,080
Caleb found out he has hepatitis A.

236
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,920
I have hepatitis A, which I think got from-

237
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
So what does that one do?

238
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,600
I think it instantly kills...

239
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
Yeah, it instantly kills you.

240
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Oh my god, Caleb!

241
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,720
Did you get that blood work done like months ago?

242
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
No!

243
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
He's faking it for attention.

244
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
He's dead!

245
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
He's faking it for attention.

246
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Caleb died.

247
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
These are my death rattles.

248
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
He's dead!

249
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
I'm not faking it.

250
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
He's dead!

251
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
He's not dead, it's our friend!

252
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,720
He's holding his microphone.

253
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,800
This is a muscle spasm, a twitch, my dying shaking.

254
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,560
Now he's stealing jokes from Futurama.

255
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560

287
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,080
do that voice I think it's I think the character is fake I think it's animated

288
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:23,760
hired Bob Marley to play him dr. Farnsworth he's in a harm's world I

289
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,080
I don't think Bob Marley played him.

290
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:45,280
You know that, hey babe, you know that's Bob Marley. That's his final role.

291
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:51,040
That doctor is actually Bob Marley. They wrote the whole show. They had all these

292
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,400
these clips of Bob Marley.

293
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,000
Yeah, it was actually like-

294
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They're supposed to come out in the 70s.

295
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,680
They cut it together from his songs.

296
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,160
That's why his dialogue never makes sense.

297
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Yeah.

298
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Hey, how am I looking today?

299
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160

343
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:57,360
just like yeah they just speed that up that's what it is that's why it does

344
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,720
that sound it's just I think every character on Futurama is I think that's true yeah

345
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,040
voiced by Bob Marley main comedian chips and dip they're really good I forgot

346
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,440
about that guy yeah he had a bit about chips and dip that I heard when I was

347
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,520
like in fourth grade and I was like you know it's crazy that that's his name but

348
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,880
he's actually a good comedian too I didn't realize that there was such there's

349
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,480
this multi hyphenate Bob Marley yeah he had I didn't know that he could do both

350
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,200
he has to go by Bob Marley comedian both reggae and comedy that would be funny if

351
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
he went cuz he doesn't talk I don't think he has like a bit about it I don't

352
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:44,720
think he talks I don't think he talks I think he goes out there is like wait

353
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,200
there's no way he doesn't talk about the fact that his name is Bob Marley I he's

354
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,360
probably does it like a very early I don't think I think it's the type of

355
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,480
thing where he does it and your next guy's really funny you've seen him on

356
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,640
Conan O'Brien I think the way they them in Jamaica the way Marley comes out yeah

357
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,840
like the way just there on vacation the way that he talks and stuff I feel like

358
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,400
that's just it's just enough of a joke already for them to say Bob Marley and

359
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,760
him yeah I'm just do his like main routine and that accent would you see

360
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:22,080
Put him in the heart of the art of Zion. Bob Marley. Bob, Bob Marley.

361
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,100
You've seen him on Futurama. He does every voice on Futurama. Put your hands together

362
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:38,320
for Bob Marley. Bob, Bob, Bob. He's just doing jokes. He's doing jokes that are just lines.

363
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,680
yeah yeah, I shot the buffalo.

364
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,440
He played the dog on on Futurama two and he's like both both both

365
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,140
both

366
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,820
like the R in the end of Soulja Boy.

367
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,060
(laughing)

368
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,920
- Oh yeah, he also--

369
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,860
- He also did all the sound effects,

370
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,080
so when there's a helicopter, he goes like,

371
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,780
lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo lo.

372
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,020
(laughing)

373
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,820
- Yeah, and the theme song.

374
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,380
- Pretty much every sound you've ever heard

375
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,220
was actually a--

376
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,300
- It was a Bob Marley sample.

377
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,340
- It's a Bob Marley sample.

378
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,260
He's the most sampled man in history.

379
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,100
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,100
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
- Yep, it's true.

382
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,580
- Yep, it's actually true.

383
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
We at who sampled dot com.

384
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
I'm Adam ruins everything.

385
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Futurama actually did not sample any of Bob Marley's voice.

386
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,580
It's a common misconception.

387
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,580
Futurama is completely made up of Bob Marley vocal samples.

388
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,580
Actually not true.

389
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,580
Actually only the Jamaican guy is Bob Marley.

390
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,580
And yes, the dog.

391
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:54,580
And some of Zoidberg's lines.

392
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,020
Soydberg is actually voiced by the comedian Bob Marley.

393
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:02,460
Do you guys want to start a huge disinformation campaign about something?

394
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,100
Absolutely.

395
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,260
Yeah.

396
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,300
That'd be cool.

397
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:04,940
I could do that.

398
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,140
We should do that with the Borat thing that you made up.

399
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,100
Oh yeah.

400
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,780
Where Borat never actually says "my wife".

401
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,380
Borat never actually says the words "my wife".

402
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,100
No, he doesn't say "my wife".

403
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,180
He says "my wife".

404
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,100
He doesn't go like "my wife".

405
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:19,820
Yes, he does.

406
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,700
He doesn't look at the camera and go "my wife".

407
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,340
Yeah, but that's like the way people say like no, I'm right about this. You're

408
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,780
completely. No, you're not. It's an insane thing to claim that he never says.

409
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,420
My wife says this is my wife, but he doesn't go like, okay, well, you know what

410
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,820
it is is people say my wife in the cadence that he says high five in and he

411
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:44,380
doesn't say it in that cadence. He doesn't go my wife in the movie. He goes

412
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,660
high five. He says, did you know Borat never actually says my wife in that

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,500
We would make so much money.

437
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500

I feel like that might be the number one hit single in China.

460
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,940
I would love to be a slave to a farmer in China.

461
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,500
Yeah.

462
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,540
I don't think you'd like that.

463
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,580
I don't think I wouldn't.

464
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,300

I would love to be a slave to a farmer in China.

467
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,620
Everyone always says like, "Oh, I want to go to be like a farmer."

468
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,300
Everyone of those like...

469
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:20,100
No, they see the videos of people farming in China and should be like, "I need to live like this."

470
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,780
But they wouldn't be able to do it.

471
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,140
and i would be able to do it either unless i was a slave in force to

472
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,860

00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,400
As soon as I get to jail. No. As soon as I get to jail.

510
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,400
That's a bad rule man. I'm standing there like a pig. That's how you get them to like you.

511
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I put an apple in my belly and I lay down on the table. Here's what you gotta do first day of jail. You gotta walk in the middle

512
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,400
of the cafeteria and say, "Hey guys if anyone just wants to fuck me, I'm just

513
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:55,780
just

514
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,900
somebody to fuck your butt. No, it means you're cool, I think. That's the thing that would

515
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:06,180
go around on Facebook? The picture? It'd be a picture of you. Yeah. Is that swag means

516
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,660
secretly we are gay? Yeah, it does actually mean that. Yeah. The sagging one's not true,

517
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:18,660
but that one's true. It was invented by scientists as an acronym to trick people, to trick jocks.

518
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,260
- Nerds invented it to pick Jock.

519
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,100
- Do you know sheesh?

520
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,060
(laughing)

521
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,380
- What if we come up with a word that Jock loves?

522
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,500
- What if we develop an acronym?

523
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,900
- Develop an acronym?

524
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,980
- Did you know that sheesh?

525
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,740
- It's one of the most-- - Swag, that's perfect.

526
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,860
- Powerful acronyms.

527
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,900
It's the coolest word ever,

528
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,320
but secretly it means that they're homosexual.

529
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,500
(laughing)

530
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,780
You probably don't even know what that means.

531
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,620
- Yeah.

532
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,700
(laughing)

533
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,020
I guess they have to look up the dictionary definition

534
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:44,860
for homosexual. - Yeah, 'cause I don't think

535
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,420
they've even seen a dictionary in their life,

536
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,260
let alone touched one.

537
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,500
(laughing)

538
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,660
we're professors we're scientists professor at Harvard we're three

539
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:05,520
scientists slash professors guys hanging out at their apartment is we have to

540
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,060
develop a theory we're gonna develop the most powerful acronym we have to take

541
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:15,580
down the cool guys my little that that did put a they were trying to why why

542
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,940
I would say like a fucking war on swag.

543
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,900
Like why did they not want swag to happen?

544
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,300
- Oh, do you, when people were saying SWAGIT at people?

545
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,420
- Dude, what? - Oh, yeah.

546
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,860
- What was up with that?

547
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,060
Why was that such a hot button issue

548
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,620
for like two years, bro?

549
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,820
- I mean, it's 'cause like,

550
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,940
I mean, it was the classists. - It was the election cycle.

551
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:34,780
- Oh, yeah, true.

552
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,140
- It was the class people versus the swag people.

553
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:38,980
- Yeah.

554
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,420
- People who-- - No, 'cause the people

555
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,500
who said SWAGIT did not have class.

556
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,340
- That's true.

557
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
That's true, that's classless.

558
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
That was absolutely classless.

559
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Yeah, but you know what it was?

560
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,340
People with swag were getting all the girls and they weren't...

561
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
That's true.

562
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
They were cleaning them up.

563
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,340
The guys with class weren't treating women like gentlemen.

564
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,340
The guys with class were pissed off they were spending so much money on belts.

565
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Then the swag...

566
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,340
And then here comes one guy with an Obey snapback.

567
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
That's what I'm saying.

568
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
And he's sweeping the floor.

569
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,340
Literally, he's the janitor.

570
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:18,780
janitor the janitor had swag back in the day and he's fucking all the girls it's

571
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,940
simple that the janitor used to fuck the girl actually they sent him to jail

572
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:27,980
because he had too much swag yeah yeah I think I sent him to jail and he became

573
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:31,500
like the jail janitor pretty much there's no girls to fuck there yeah I

574
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,740

- This guy's not a skater.

586
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,460

587
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,460
the sweet and sour pork,

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,260
- Dude, it's also, there's like this big brother interview

595
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,620
"Oh, I'm a really good manipulator,

596
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:45,240

he's good at manipulating men in prison that's cool that's that is cool they're

602
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,820
Prisoners it doesn't matter anything you do in there doesn't count when you get out

603
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,860
I guess that's that's the point of being in there is that when you're out your it's it's a different your different rules

604
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,100
Yeah, I said they said they're his nickname in prison was like the cuddle monster

What if I held you down?

615

I genuinely do not like being tickled and you know that.

616
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,900
What if I sat on your back and tickled you?

617

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
You better not.

619
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,740

620
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740

I'm laying on the floor right now for no reason.

625
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,500
You're not on the floor.

626
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
Look at him, dude.

627
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,500
He's so afraid.

628
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Do you want to stand up?

629
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Do you want to just stand up and stand next to him?

630
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,220
I'm not laying down for any particular reason.

631
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,220
What if we just approach you?

632
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
You look cute right now.

633
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,220

I just hold it, I hold a feather.

670
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,880
The wheel of Patrick.

671
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,320
I hold a feather like the point on the wheel of fortune and he just goes by and it tickles

672
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,480
his feet and his neck and his head.

673
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
I would love that.

674
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,440
And if it lands on his nuts, I get to go.

675
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,560
To me, I think that's the worst fetish.

676
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,680
Tickling? Yeah. You think that's worse than pedophilia? Yeah. I would, yeah.

677
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,360
Okay. I think the tier list, well because- The tier list? Okay. The tier- He has a tier list.

678
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,440
So what's the tier- Let's get right into the list today.

679
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,960
Pat's fetish tier list? No, the worst- What's S tier?

680
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,280
Worst po- What is the most disgusting and immoral sexual- No, start S tier. No, come on. Start S

681
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,160
tier. I think, I don't, pedophilia is not a fetish. It's a- Oh, so that's S tier. It's a disease.

682
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
I asked what SDR was and you're bringing up pedophilia.

683
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
Okay, so he thinks it's not their fault and they shouldn't go to jail.

684
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
Oh, fuck.

685
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,160
He thinks that they, yeah, okay.

686
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
I think they should be rounded up and put into a van.

687
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
And you should take to hang out with them.

688
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Okay.

689
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Rounded up and brought to my party.

690
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Okay, what's the worst of the worst?

691
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Well, the worst is pedophilia.

692
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
Oh, really?

693
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
He switched up on us.

694
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Oh, really?

695
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,160
I think it's tied with tickling.

696
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,760
That's the craziest thing anybody's ever said on the show.

697
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,400
And a three-way tie is probably pedophilia, particularly poop eating.

698
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,920
Poop eating isn't that crazy to me.

699
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,840
He's been talking a lot about eating poop lately.

700
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,360
I've been talking about eating poop as long as you guys have known me.

701
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,400
That's true.

702
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,480
I've always talked about eating poop.

703
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
I don't want to.

704
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,840
You know what it is?

705
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,960
He's been having too many dreams about me having sex.

706
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,120
Not a lot, dude.

707
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,320
he's had he's had like three about you having said three in the past two weeks

708
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,320
and then I wake up and nothing happens

709
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:04,320
no you told me another dream today Ariana Grande when I do this you do he's

710
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,880
changing the subject I look just like he does he has don't you know sexual dreams

711
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,960
he calls me in the middle of the night to tell me about them yeah describes them

712
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:19,120
in detail not don't yeah he's making shit he says I just had the cuddliest dream

713
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,760
I just had the cuddliest most ticklish dream Cameron you're not gonna believe

714
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,680
it Patrick became a cuddle bug in my dream

715
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,720
and then the tickle monster cries so he's saying and then you go but do you

716
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,240
think that could actually happen with that what happened for real do you think

717
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,320
it would happen in real life it's and the scary part is I woke up that's right

718
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,120
The scariest part is I couldn't tell if it was a dream or not.

719
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,920
I don't have sex dreams about you.

720
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,920
Stop throwing the comment.

721
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:47,920
You have sex dreams about me?

722
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,520
Not s- I've never had sex with either of you in my dreams.

723
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
That- you- why are you winking?

724
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,920
I've had sex with a lake monster and never you guys.

725
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
A lake monster?

726
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
I told you about this.

727
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,920
The Loch Ness Monster?

728
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
No, I had sex with a monster in a lake.

729
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,320
Like ten- like probably ten dreams back.

730
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Yeah, he told us about it.

731
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
I remember the lake monster.

732
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,160
I was waking I was like fucking like a monster and I like almost busted like a

737
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,360
just a neck it was like a box with a neck and like a like a giraffe head so

738
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,520
So it was kind of like Loch Ness, but it was like just a box.

739
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,120
And I was just fucking it and I woke up and I was almost cumming in my pants.

740
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,280
I had to like hold my penis down.

741
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,400
Jesus.

742
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,680
What is that Jesus?

746
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,160

749
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,360
Oh, you shouldn't have...

750
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,040
That's a nasty dream.

751
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,280
Caleb came into his living room this afternoon.

752
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,680
You came in here, you were gray sweatpants challenged up.

753
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,840
- And then I woke up and I went to the bathroom

754
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,680
and I had to pee really bad.

755
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,680
And then I had to shove my hard dick under the toilet seat

756
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,960
'cause I was sitting down,

757
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,000
'cause you can't pee with a boner standing up.

758
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,840
And then it was just-- - Yeah, you can.

759
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,960
- It was just touching the underside of the toilet seat

760
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,800
and getting like doo-doo all over my tip.

761
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,480
- Dude, I'm so good at it.

762
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,080
Like in the morning when you wake up.

763
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,600
- Yeah, there's a way to do it.

764
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,480
- We are like stone.

765
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,160
- Yeah, the hardest you'll ever be.

766
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,640
You wake up like granite.

767
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
Yeah.

768
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:37,120
And you go over to the toilet and you do that thing where you like...

769
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,120
You have to like stand.

770
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
Yeah.

771
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
You stand.

772
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,960
You're like fucking your toilet.

773
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,360
You're fucking your pee into the toilet.

774
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,480
You're making your butt a shelf and you're like trying to pee down.

775
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,920
Yeah, you're basically making your butt a lawnmower and you're fucking, shitting pee

776
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,000
into the toilet.

777
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,240
Yeah, I'm...

778
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,320
My toilet is grass and I'm the mower.

779
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,200
My grandma said that to me once.

780
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,560
said my step grandma grass and I'm the mower step grandma doesn't make sense

786
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,740

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,560
and I don't want people to get that idea. I'm gonna step on your grandma's neck.

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,440
I'm gonna wear big high heels, red bottoms. Oh my god. I'm gonna step on her.

795
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,080
I'm gonna do it with flip-flops. I'm gonna I'm gonna pierce. Does it smell really bad?

796
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,520
It's not the same as like when you guys make fun of my mom and I feel

797
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,080
like I have to defend her. I'm gonna use the heel of my high heels and I'm gonna

798

00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,160
I don't know why you're doing that.

802
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
I'm gonna manually-

803
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,440
You're trying to like get me to like react and it's not working.

804
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
I'm trying to get you to come over to me so I can tickle you.

805
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,440
Yeah.

806
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,320
I'm gonna walk through like a horse stable in flip-flops so the like manure is like all

807
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
it's like between my toes and on the bottom of the flip-flop.

808
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,320
You're gonna step on my step grandma?

809
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,320
Uh no.

810
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I'm just gonna do that.

811
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,720
- Okay.

813
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,520
- In your dad, and then I'm gonna walk on your step.

00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,280
In your dad, I'm gonna install,

815
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,880

- I installed the-- - I'm gonna install a Keurig

817
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,160
in your dad's back.

818
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,400
- I installed Sirius XM in my dad's belly.

819
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,240
- Well you know when they do--

820
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,680
- And I listen to Stern on there.

821
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,120
- You know when they do, when they have to check

822
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,480
a cow's stomach and they put that hole on the side of it

823
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,320
so you can reach it? - Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

824
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,480
- I'm gonna do that with your dad

825
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,240
so I can feel all the hot dogs he eats.

826
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,960
(laughing)

827
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,500
- They do what to cows?

828
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,340
- They put a hole on the side of them.

829
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,160
- You never seen that?

830
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,000
It's so crazy.

831
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,120
- So they can put like their, you know,

832
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,600
you know when they deal--

833
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
- Like a living cow.

834
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,600

- Shut up, shut up about my dad.

849
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,760
And then I'm gonna call his work and tell him that a pirate's coming to kill everyone.

850
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,040
[Laughs]

852
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Cow hole.

853
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I wish I heard that.

854
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm sorry for interrupting you.

855
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I'm looking up.

856
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh look, yeah, you never seen that?

857
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh my god!

858
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,160
They put a hole on the side of the fucking cow.

859
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
What?

860
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,160
Yeah.

861
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,040
And it just sputters and spits out.

862
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,000
I mean it's fine, I can't feel pain.

863
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,320
Yeah, it doesn't do anything.

864
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
It doesn't do anything.

865
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,160
Look, that lady's got her whole arm in there.

866
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,280
It has no effect.

867
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
It's crazy, yeah.

868
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,680
funny that they think they're like they're like well there's no way that

869
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,680
would hurt their entire life to have a huge hole yeah there's no way that does

870
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,440
anything you never heard of this you really haven't know what the fuck what's

871
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,640
it called there's a name for holes are openings on the side of the cow that

872
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,840
looks like a scientific name holes are openings on the side of the cow that

873
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,520
allows researchers to access an animal stomach with a cannula you just do that

00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:43,380
to like any animal listen yeah they do that to every animal experts say that in

875
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:49,860
some cases cows with portholes live longer. Yeah, because they put more food in there easily.

876
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:57,060
Dude, that's... it's cool. Can you imagine how much... I'm having like a genuine... It's a cannula.

- Yeah, basically I'm just like the greenest guy ever.

903
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,060

00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,300
- Yeah, I'm like green as--

905
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,820

00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:02,380
- You're green as the day is long.

907
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:04,460
- Basically green like money.

908
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,300
- There we go.

909
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,140
- Okay, we're getting somewhere.

910
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,860
good and green and here's a hint

911
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:16,580
Caleb's penis like my penis is not really like the penis Caleb sucks now okay, so

912
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:19,180
if I'm going to suck a penis yeah, it'd probably be a really microscopically

913
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:23,940
small one like an ants yeah yeah, that's you're going to go to jail for that

914
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:28,540
that's animal abuse yeah, you can't go to jail for abusing an ant. Yeah, you

915
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:28,760
can.

916
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:34,420
If you put your dick on an ant, you won't go to jail. You will go to jail.

917
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,640
teenage son went to juvie because he was sexually abusing the ants in his

918
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,660
aunt's farm.

919
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,460
He put honey all over his dick to get a bee to suck it.

920
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,540
I put pollen on my penis.

921
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,040
Yeah.

922
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,740
I got to get a bee to impregnate me.

923
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,240
I got impregnated by a bee.

924
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,840
I don't think that you can go to jail for abusing anybody.

925
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
I think you have to go to jail.

926
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,640
How big, where do they draw the line where it's illegal to just randomly murder?

927
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,740
It just depends on what the judge says in court.

928
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,620
Is that really true? They don't have like a lot, they don't have like a...

929
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:09,820
Yeah, that's true. You go to court if you fuck a bug.

930
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:13,020
And they have a trial to decide if you go to jail or not.

931
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:16,700
They might. If you... Okay, so I... Like a horned beetle, you should not be able to fuck that.

932
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,860
You probably can't.

933
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,460
But an ant or a worm?

934
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,220
You should be able to... So you think you should be able to fuck an ant?

935
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:22,860
Yeah.

936
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:26,540
What's the biggest bug? The biggest bug is like a moth. There are giant moths, right?

937
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,140
Those, they're really big moths.

938
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,660
No, you did not.

939
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,460
Uh-huh.

940
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:30,940
Nope.

941
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:31,740
I fucked your ant.

942
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,300
You did not.

943
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:37,740
I'm gonna search biggest bug. Your Aunt Judy. I don't have an Aunt Judy. Actually I think I do have an Aunt Judy.

944
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:42,380
Yeah. I think she's my great aunt. And you're... You fucked her? And I'm Uncle Patrick. She has twin children.

945
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:48,140
Yeah. Yeah. Okay well here's our new list because we... I forgot we had a list and we went really

946
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:53,820
long. Here's our new list. 10 biggest bugs on earth. All right. Okay. All right and we'll find

947
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:59,340
a line here. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Stag beetle. How big is it? Three inches long. That's...

948
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:07,300
that would never you can fuck that is the size of like the biggest penis

949
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,560
the stag beetle is the size of the biggest people listen to this true

950
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,600
the three inch long male stag beetle may be most easily recognized by its spiky

951
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,840
front antlers also known as mandibles which are a key part of courtship

952
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,860
rituals and wrestling matches you'd have more to fear from the slightly smaller

953
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:26,500
females though which don't have the giant spikes but you have a more fearsome bite

954
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,060
so it rather for the mailer female well the thing is that the whole matter

955
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,980
lately i'm i'm i'm not even one of focus beetle

956
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,780
but if it is all of its it's beckoning me with its horns i made

957
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,660

would you rather have sex with a man

961
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:56,100
here's a question would rather sex in the mailer being at the state deals

962
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:01,460
really good for you because it says here, "Researchers point to the long maturation time, four whole

963
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:07,300
years it takes for them to be adults." From larva to adult, that's four years.

964
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,060
That me up. That me up.

965
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,100

You've been talking about how you smell all day.

967
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,300
Yeah, because I had a fart problem.

968
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,140
You did? It stunk up the entire apartment.

969
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,660
I woke up today and I thought that I farted.

970
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,540
We've had to spend the night at my place, Cameron.

971
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,740
I did sleep the night.

972
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,300

973
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,420

00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,500
We had another pajama accident. We had a pajama interaction.

976
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,620
Yeah, I told you guys I think I fought, I do think I fought like a demon

977
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,180
or something in my sleep.

978
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,540
Would you wake up busting?

979
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,900
A dream demon.

980
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,500
No, I just, I usually have crazy dreams and I didn't take melatonin or anything.

981
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,220
I had no dreams at all and I like fell asleep instantly and then woke up and I

982
00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:00,700
I felt like I had been fighting all night. You covered in scratches. Yeah, I didn't

983
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,060
do anything yesterday, so I wouldn't have I wasn't like tired, but I think I think

984
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:08,580
I think like Mr. Krueger pulled me under. Maybe it's possible. What if you had like

985
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:14,140
a dream where you were like a knight or like like like a knight or something or

986
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,740
somebody that like fought the devil or like you know a Jedi and you're fighting

987
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:23,740
Darth Vader and you wake up with just like a puddle of nut in your pants. What

988
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,860
would that say about you wait you have a dream where both your parents die in a

989
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,820
car crash I know that I think about it I'm kind of worried that I woke up

990
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:37,460
feeling like I had a battle because the other night I destroyed a shelf in my

991
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:47,820
sleep in my I forgot about that you told me that I got up asleep with sleep

992
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:55,100
walked and I just walked into the wall and just knocked the shelf.

993
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,500
You like you walked out of your apartment saw a guy that kind of looked

994
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
like a demon.

995
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,900

997
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,280
I hope I find out that I killed somebody.

998
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,380
You could be like a that'd be cool to be you're like a superhero.

999
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,140
There's been an ad playing about that because like yeah there's been an ad on

1000
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:20,180
on Hulu playing that's been like have you or anyone you know

1001
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:25,360
with Anna and then it will come on and be like this man stabbed his

1002
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:29,560
girlfriend twenty nine times in his sleep. Beware of sleepwalkers.

1003
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,320
It's like a true crime show yeah. Oh my God, you didn't know yeah,

1004
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,880
I've never got an ad like that. I never do. I've never got a PSA for

1005
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,880
sleep. It's not a PSA. It's like a show about a guy who did that.

1006
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,180
It's like a true crime show. Never heard of that damn. What's the

1007
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,640
That looks scary. The next bug is Goliath Beetle.

1008
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,640
Oh my.

1009
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,640
That sounds pretty damn big.

1010
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:53,040
4.5 inches long and 3.5 ounces.

1011
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
Now we're getting somewhere.

1012
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:58,240
See, that's big. That would go, the biggest piece would fit in there.

1013
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,080
Is it wrong to kill that bug for absolutely zero reason?

1014
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,080
Yes.

1015
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Yeah.

1016
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,080
You think so?

1017
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,800
I think, what is the size cut off?

1018
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:11,120
I think the size cut off for that, I think it also depends on if it's a fast moving bug

1019
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,240
or a slow moving bug.

1020
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:14,240
You got a fast bug.

1021
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,400
I don't know why I agree. It's completely true. A fast bug, I don't care, can die no matter what.

1022
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:29,280
A slow bug. Because I was thinking like, I wouldn't kill this for no reason, but a centipede

1023
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,840
that's the exact same size I would immediately kill if it was running quickly. Oh absolutely.

1024
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:37,040
Dude, like a centipede. Well I guess if this one was running quickly I'd probably kill it too.

1025
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,160
I think it's probably because you can't catch it and set it free without it like.

1026
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,880
Well it's because you have to worry about it. Also, if that centipede.

1027
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,240
If this thing is slow and it's in the corner of my room, I can just like chill and it'll

1028
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:47,640
like walk around or whatever.

1029
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,440
And then we could just, you can put it on a piece of paper and bring it outside.

1030
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,440
Yeah.

1031
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,920
But if it's fast as fuck, you're never getting rid of it.

1032
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,920
If it's fast, it's evil.

1033
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,640
And when it jumps at you like a scare, like a jump scare.

1034
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,640
Yeah.

1035
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,640
If it's fast, it's evil.

1036
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,640
Yeah, I agree.

1037
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,640
Yeah, definitely.

1038
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,640
Fast bugs are evil.

1039
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,640
I think we're programmed to not like fast shit.

1040
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,640
Definitely.

1041
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,640
Yeah.

1042
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,640
But a slow bug.

1043
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,640
Yeah, cause like, you know, like a cheetah.

1044
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,640
Mm-hmm.

1045
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:08,640
Yep.

1046
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,640
Cheetah comes running at you.

1047
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,140
I can be liable to think a mosquito is a cheetah if it goes fast enough.

1048
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,140
Mosquito?

1049
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,760
The next bug, the giant walking stick.

1050
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,860
But this one could die is the other thing.

1051
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:24,360
Not all giant bugs are outfitted with terrifyingly sharp jaws and a suit of external armor.

1052
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,940
The giant walking stick looks practically dainty.

1053
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,120
How long is it?

1054
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:31,760
Up to 21 inches when measured from toe to toe.

1055
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,200
Show me that.

1056
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,200
What the fuck?

1057
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,680
It just shows it's not an interesting picture.

1058
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
Yeah it is.

1059
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,680
That's a bug.

1060
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:43,480
picture of a stick just a piece of wood where's the bug you'll find them almost

1061
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:51,240
worldwide that's not you so females are bigger than males it says these insects

1062
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:56,600
are some of the most successful hiders in the world next to me I could find one

1063
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,880
I'll find right now so what do you guys think about this one I think that this

1064
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,880
one I don't I would kill what about I thought we'd started out talking about

1065
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,560
about fucking them. Oh yeah, I'd fuck that too. Can you fuck it?

1066
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,400
Anything that I... Can you fuck it without going to jail? Okay, so

1067
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,560
actually that's the line. If I would kill it, I would not fuck it.

1068
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:17,280
Yeah. But also if you... That's good to know. Yeah. Well, I... No,

1069
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,160
wait. No, it's not about me fucking these. Sorry. It's all about... It's

1070
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,340
about you. Okay. It's not about if it's legal, it's just would you go

1071
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:29,000
to jail? For fucking a stick bug? No, 'cause the judge would be impressed

1072
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,760
that you found it.

1073
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:39,280
judge slams down the hammer is just like hmm well this case is dismissed can I

1074
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,680
see the book can you give me the bug so he fucked nothing so you fucked this it

1075
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:52,160
doesn't even know you fucked this table this evidence table your honor your

1076
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,280
honor look closely with the magnifying glass damn that's a better honor please

1077
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,340
- Can you please refer to the bug detector?

1078
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,180
(laughing)

1079
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:00,020
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1080
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:00,840
- Oh!

1081
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,180
- I was gonna say, he's losing his mind!

1082
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,020
- Over just some damn stick!

1083
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,080
This thing is broken!

1084
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,760
- Oh, yeah, my bad, it's not calibrated.

1085
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,800
- Yeah, next one is Queen Alexandra Birdwing Butterfly.

1086
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,540
This one's Queen Alexandra.

1087
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,380
- You can't fuck a butterfly.

1088
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,100
- You can't fuck something named Queen Alexandra.

1089
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,240
- Yeah, no, if you fuck a butterfly, I think you go to hell.

1090
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,080
- Yes.

1091
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,920
- Wingspan can reach as much as one foot across.

1092
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,000
- If you ever kill a butterfly--

1093
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
What?

1094
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Show me this.

1095
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
None of them have size comparisons.

1096
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,240
I would be so scared if I saw that.

1097
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,720
You kill a butterfly, you should be able to get killed.

1098
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,280
Moths, there are moths that get way bigger than that.

1099
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
A foot?

1100
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,680
Yeah, well I'm sure there will be a moth on this list.

1101
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,020
Moth man.

1102
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,400
Moth man you can kill or fuck and it doesn't matter.

1103
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,400
What's your...

1104
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,040
Okay, well next bug.

1105
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,480
Next bug here is...

1106
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:51,480
Whoa.

1107
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:52,480
Let me see.

1108
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,720
That thing is fucking crazy.

1109
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,160
A giant sex crazed moth?

1110
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
Is that what it says?

1111
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,160
Yeah.

1112
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
Oh yeah.

1113
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,280
Have you ever seen those, what's the kind of moth that has a really fucked up wiener

1114
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,000
and it looks like a mutant?

1115
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,560
Is it fucked up what?

1116
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,560
Wiener.

1117
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,320
Oh, you actually did say wiener.

1118
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,160
Yeah, you said wiener perfectly fine the first time.

1119
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,680
No I thought you said, I thought you said like, for,

1120
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,680
Wiener?

1121
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,680
I didn't, yeah.

1122
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:25,120
I thought you said wiener and I genuinely for a second thought that that was like a part

1123
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:29,280
of a bug like a thorax. I hate bugs man. Yeah.

1124
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,600
Continue. Next one Titan beetle. The latin name of this beetle pretty much says it

1125
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:42,000
all. Titanus giganteus. Imagine using the scientific name. It's eight inches long.

1126
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,520
And it has the scientific name. This is some kind of. Titanus giganteus. This must be a

1127
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:52,360
giganto hugisoid. This is the biggest thing I've ever seen. It's eight inches.

1128
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:59,360
It's not called like, "Insectus Titanus Chug It" it's just, "It's the big titan."

1129
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,880
This is the biggest titan I've ever seen!

1130
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,600
I was thinking he sees like a bug that's like way bigger and he's just like, "Ah, shit!"

1131
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:15,600
I think the murder thing, the bug murder thing, kind of like, it's morally wrong to kill anything

1132
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,480
above a bee.

1133
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
I think a bee, I think you can kill a bee.

1134
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,480
Yeah, for sure.

1135
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,280
A bee, like you know, who gives a fuck?

1136
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,280
What kind of bee?

1137
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,680
There's one thing about bees is there's so many of them.

1138
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,680
There's too many.

1139
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:30,400
Most bugs it's fine because there are a bunch of them, but if it's like a fancy bug.

1140
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,400
Three summers ago, I had one of the worst days of my life.

1141
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:38,540
My fucking mother-in-law made me pick up a tennis racket and go out and kill every bee

1142
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,080
in their yard for like three hours.

1143
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,880
I was just swatting bees out of the air.

1144
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:42,880
You were made to do this?

1145
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,880
She asked me to.

1146
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,560
You can say no.

1147
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,560
Mama told me.

1148
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,560
That's my...

1149
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:48,960
You can say no thank you.

1150
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,960
No, I gotta respect my mother-in-law.

1151
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,960
No please.

1152
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:52,960
You can say no please.

1153
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:53,960
That doesn't make any sense.

1154
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,360
You don't understand southern hospitality.

1155
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,600
If a mother-in-law tells you to kill, you do it.

1156
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,880
Okay, here we go.

1157
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
Damn, that sucks.

1158
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
I probably killed 150 bees.

1159
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:03,880
I would never.

1160
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
Next one is dung beetle.

1161
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,440
I would never listen to my damn mother-in-law.

1162
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:07,440
Dung beetle?

1163
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:08,440
Dung beetle.

1164
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,440
You can kill and fuck that.

1165
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,440
Doesn't matter.

1166
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,960
Though the dung beetle doesn't have the size advantage of some of the other beetles and

1167
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,960
bugs on this list, it overpowers them in one key way.

1168
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,880
gifted with Hulk type strength. It can move more doo-doo. But why are they so

1169
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,320
strong? Researchers explained that males need to be tough enough to fight off

1170
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,760
rivals who would try to pull them out of the holes they go into in order to mate

1171
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,280
with females. What does a dung beetle look like? This, a turd. Looks like a beetle.

1172
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,560
I've seen one of those before. Yeah? Yeah, moving around your poo-poo. Yep. In my

00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:44,620
toilet. Oh. I put it there. Next one's giant water bug. You seen those? Those are

You're a piece of shit.

1184
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,380
You're crazy.

1185
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,300
Many have more than 62 square inches of wing.

1186
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,860
That's cheating.

1187
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,860
Give me the length.

1188
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:19,860
It doesn't say the length.

1189
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,860

Because big moths are crazy because they have big bodies too.

1193
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:32,980
Do they eat huge chunks out of shirts still?

1194
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,740
Yeah, they eat skin.

1195
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:35,740
Why do they do that?

1196
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:36,740
They eat your skin.

1197
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,740
