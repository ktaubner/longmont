Let me see your butt.

(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,560
(explosion)

9
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,400
- Yeah.

10
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,220
- Yeah.

11
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,060
- Yeah.

12
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,960
- Wait, so when people listen to a podcast,

13
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,440
do they hold their phone up to their ears like this?

14
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,280
- Yeah.

15
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,100
- Yeah.

16
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:20,940
- Really?

17
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,120
- Yeah, like this.

18
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,240
- Like they put it up like they're talking on the phone?

19
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,120
- They do it exactly like this.

20
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,960
- Right guys?

21
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:27,780
- Like they're talking on the phone, right?

22
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,880
- Yeah, they do it like that.

23
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,720
- Like this.

24
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,840
like that like this but they did it we're pointing at the same thing no they do it

25
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,520
vastly thusly sometimes yeah yeah how about as pictured they do it as

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,760
pictured do they do do we do the podcast as a picture sometimes we could do that

27
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,640
I guess yeah I just release a picture instead of an episode one week well yeah

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,240
I think that if we do it's like a big enough picture with enough stuff going on

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,240
It would take an hour to look at.

30
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:56,740
Yeah.

31
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,740
Then they'd be like, well that's the same.

32
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,740
Yeah, that is. You can't argue with that.

33
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,240
Plus, you don't have to wear headphones.

34
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,740
So, you know what we would need to do?

35
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,240
What?

36
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,740
We need to do, we'd need to make an eye spy.

37
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,240
Because that's the only thing that you're going to get an hour's worth of entertainment out.

38
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Or a really hard magic eye.

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,740
Where you have to stare at it for an hour before the 3D comes out.

40
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,240
Yeah.

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,740
Alright, well those are already very hard for me.

42
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,740
Or a picture of like a bunch of words.

43
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,240
True.

44
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,780
Oh, we could just do a picture of a podcast. Okay, but some people are speed readers

45
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,660
Go around

46
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:38,580
Lives catering to the speed readers. Exactly. You're a speed reader. Fuck you speed readers are fucking dog shit, dude

47
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,080
Uh-huh. I know you didn't I know you didn't hear Harry Potter's voice in your head

48
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,620
You don't even know what he sounds like you don't know that there's emotional tenor behind his words. Oh

49
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,740
See speed reader sounds like speed reader. That's what it sounds like no, that's you know, what do you mean?

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,700
That's what he sounds like. No, he doesn't yes. He does. He's more child. How did he sound? Okay?

51
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,260
No, that's Ron Mary Porter, that's Ron Ron says that Ron's are this

52
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,940
That's wrong. That's Hagrid

53
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,100
What that was Hagrid? Yeah, hey

54
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,400
Marnie Granger that is when I'm here to take the test

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,220
She's so I'm here to do my own work and take a test. Yeah get her

56
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:31,660
Fucking door of doing homework. Oh my god. Are you watching this? Are you seeing what he's doing? I love to I love to

57
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,380
wash my arms

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,580
Bitch, and follow the rules bitch. Oh

59
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,540
You Hermione green. I have a bedtime

60
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,380
Bet she does actually and it's 830 and do you follow it? I follow my

61
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,980
What do you think about chores or mining I love chores what

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:59,340
Yeah, which all of them all of them all of them. What about playing? Oh, yeah. Oh my god

63
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,580
I hate playing and I love doing chores

64
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,260
Potter Hermione's is a villain

65
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,380
Yes, really. Uh-huh Wow

66
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,560
I love getting people in trouble.

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,780
Oh my god.

68
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,780
I love tattletaling.

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,280
No.

70
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
You better take that one back.

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,780
I'm a turtle, I'm a snail, and I'm a tattletale.

72
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,480
You're a turtle and a snail?

73
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,780
You know the rhyme?

74
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,780
You like rhymes too?

75
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,780
I love poetry.

76
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,280
That was it.

77
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
Because it's homework.

78
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,780
That's...

79
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
Mmm.

80
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,280
For poetry class.

81
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Oh, come on.

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,780
Do they have that at Hogwarts?

83
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,120
I have it at Hogwarts and they got spells.

84
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,120
So the thing about these Hogwarts kids, they go to...

85
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,120
And they got a little goblin who's Jewish.

86
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
They go to school to like fucking...

87
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,120
The goblins control the banks.

88
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Alright, Hermione, you're edging towards something bad.

89
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,120
I've got some things to say about Israel.

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,920
"Oh, I'd love to cast a spell over there and fix all the problems."

91
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,720
And that problem is...

92
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,720
Careful now.

93
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,480
We need to cut Hermione's mic off.

94
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,360
So in Harry Potter, these kids are going to school for doing this, right?

95
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,480
Yeah, as pictures.

96
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,760
That was the motion you were doing.

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,800
They're doing Wanda waving.

98
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Thusly.

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Thusly.

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
So, can they read?

101
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Yeah.

102
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
They didn't go to reading school.

103
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
No, they definitely...

104
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,640
There's no English classes at fucking Hogwarts.

105
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,640
No. Can they even do long division? I think they do a spell that makes them learn how to read.

106
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
That is pretty funny, that last "Kerminey."

107
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Well, like, yeah, like, imagining, like, like, like wise old Dumbledore, and he walks into McDonald's, and he's like, "I'll have, uh..."

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,640
"That one."

109
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Yeah, he can't read that thing. Just a pointing.

110
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,640
Yeah. "I'll have the, uh, uh, bun."

111
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
"I'll have the one that's this many dollars."

112
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,640
"I'll have the this many meal."

113
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,440
I'll have whatever I can get for this many dollars.

114
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,940
But they can't be all that smart.

115
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,640
No, that's, yeah, they're definitely, they're probably very stupid.

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,940
I mean, really, like, illiterate, these, these, uh, what are they called?

117
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Wizards.

118
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,040
These wizards.

119
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,940
The hater said I would never recover from my head injury, but here I am.

120
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,440
I'm smarter than I ever was before.

121
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,240
Fully recovered.

122
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
My head is in it.

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Ask me a trivia question.

124
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
Congratulations.

125
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
I think I might have to apologize for the Hermione bit.

126
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,240
Go ahead.

127
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Ask me a trivia question.

128
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
This week.

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,240
What?

130
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Ask me a trivia question.

131
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:53,440
In 2003, what movie was cheaper by the dozen?

132
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Cheaper.

133
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Correct.

134
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
In 2006, there was something cheaper by the dozen...

135
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Two.

136
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,440
Yes!

137
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
More trivia, I need it.

138
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,400
Okay, in 2006, there was something that was cheaper by the dozen two.

139
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
What was it?

140
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Cheaper by the dozen two.

141
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
It's Steve Martin.

142
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
Wrong.

143
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
A movie.

144
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,440
You get a dozen movies for $10 at Walmart.

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,280
I said there was something called Cheaper by the Dozen 2.

146
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
What was it?

147
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
It was movie.

148
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
It was really obvious.

149
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
It was the easiest one yet.

150
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,640
In 2006, Eugene Levy and Steve Martin starred in what movie that was Cheaper by the Dozen

151
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
2?

152
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,520
Let me think about this.

153
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,760
Eugene Levy, Steve Martin starred in what movie that was Cheaper by the Dozen 2?

154
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm going to say Cheaper by the Dozen 2.

155
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,720
What year did Cheaper by the Dozen 2 come out three years after its prequel Cheaper by the

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,360
Dozen 1 in 2003?

157
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,360
Prequel?

158
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,040
I'm going to say 2006.

159
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Correct.

160
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Your Honor.

161
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,040
In 2003, Hilary Duff-

162
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
My Socks.

163
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,800
Wait, was she in that movie?

164
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,680
How many was it Cheaper by in 2006?

165
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,160
Two.

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,320
I think it was cheaper by... I think... Okay, so the movie's called Cheaper by the Dozen.

167
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,440
I think it's technically cheaper by 13 in that one. I think they have another kid.

168
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,840
Well, they're called the Baker's Family and it's the... the joke is that it's the Baker's

169
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,920
Dozen.

170
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,480
I didn't get that.

171
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
You didn't?

172
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
No, that one flew right over my head.

173
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
Oh.

174
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Yeah.

175
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
But it's cheaper to have 13 of them.

176
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,440
What was the name of the Baker's Family in the Dozen movies?

177
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Cheaper by the...

178
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,440
In the Dozen franchise?

179
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:57,320
In the Dozen franchise, who was the star alongside Eugene Levy and himself, Steve Martin?

180
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Steve Martin.

181
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,320
Correct.

182
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,840
When are they going to do a third Cheever by the Dozy?

183
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,320
Oh, I don't know.

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,720
2009, based on the pattern.

185
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,160
Nowadays it'd probably be a whole family of girls with a lesbian mom.

186
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't want to see that.

187
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,560
these girls make all these kids. Hey with that many girls in one house it's gonna be called

188
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,440
more expensive by the dozen. Yes sir. Jewelry, makeup, nail, nail makeup. Yeah. Whatever they

189
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,900
put on their nails. And you know that bathroom line is long. Uh huh. They have a line for

190
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,800
the bathroom in their own house. Guess how long it is. A dozen long. And you think that's

191
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,920
the water bill is not cheaper. Let me tell you what also with a dozen girls statistically

192
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:50,760
every month one of them gets their period. You don't think they'd sync up?

193
00:08:50,760 --> 00:09:00,200
Well it's cheaper to sync up. So they all at one month you're never safe.

194
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,760
So who's the star? Of cheaper by the dozen women?

195
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,000
Cheaper by the dozen three. More expensive by the dozen the girl one?

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,600
expensive by the dozen the star would probably be probably they got to bring

197
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:17,120
back bonnie we want who do we want is what girls we want to see kiss Scarlett

198
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,760
Johansson and Halle Berry I was gonna say steve uh Marta

199
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,280
steve a Marta she's she's too hot right now they she would never say yes to a

200
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:41,280
a comedy. Eunice Levy. No, I want to see some smushing. You wouldn't want to see

201
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,280
Steve Amarta and Eunice Levy? I want to walk in and just be mad at Arthur and their lips smushing.

202
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,680
Is there a reason you want this to be part of the, you could just have a movie like that. I don't

203
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,040
understand why it needs to be the third entry in a family franchise. What do you

204
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,560
You need 13 children to be in the house?

205
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,760
No, they're all grown adults.

206
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Oh, okay.

207
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Uh-huh.

208
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
Okay.

209
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,760
You know where this is going.

210
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,280
And they fuck each other, even though they're sisters.

211
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,200
So it's Steve Martin and Gianna Michaels.

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,640
No.

213
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,800
No Gianna Michaels.

214
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
She's not invited.

215
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,600
Also, it is a weight loss competition with all the girls.

216
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,600
And they're singing too.

217
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
It could be called lighter by the dozen.

218
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,440
vote on the surgeries they get with your phone. It's a live, it's a game show. It's like the

219
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,800
Bachelor. It's also a sequel to Cheaper by the Dozen. They should do a game show or a

220
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,760
reality show like that called The Beautiful One where you get 10 really ugly girls and

221
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,280
then you get to vote with your phone on what happens to them. Why is it called The Beautiful

222
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,320
One? Because at the end they become beautiful because of all the surgery. Didn't they make

223
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Was that a show?

224
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Did they?

225
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Oh, I'm thinking of Extreme Makeover.

226
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Yeah, well that kind of is Extreme Makeover.

227
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Yeah.

228
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
But also...

229
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
But Extreme Makeover Royale.

230
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
It would be a Royale.

231
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Yeah.

232
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Because they're in the woods too.

233
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
And they have to do all the surgery with like chipmunk bones and shit.

234
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Yeah.

235
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
They don't get real surgery stuff.

236
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
A lot of them are going to die of sepsis.

237
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
This is the sad truth of the matter.

238
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Well, at least, you know, you do the surgery with chipmunk bones.

239
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,320
You get pouches in your mouth.

240
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
You can store food for winter.

241
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,720
That is a really good point.

242
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
Yeah.

243
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Do you guys ever wish you had a colostomy bag?

244
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,320
Because I'm not going to shit in it all the time, so it would be fun to have a little

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
pocket.

246
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:35,680
I mean, if I had a colostomy bag and I was waiting in line at Domino's or something,

247
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
or Popeyes or something that was taking too long, I'd just whip it out and shit on the

248
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
floor.

249
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
Okay.

250
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,920
Or if, you know, I could probably use it to stop an attack.

251
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Why on the floor?

252
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
What?

253
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,920
Why on the floor?

254
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,360
Well the lines long I want everyone to leave the restaurant.

255
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
Oh that's true.

256
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,960
So you wouldn't use the bag though?

257
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,720
No I would lift up my shirt, take the, poke the tube out and just start like spraying it

258
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
on the people in front of me.

259
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Oh I see.

260
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,720
Yeah.

261
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
That's nasty.

262
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Yeah.

263
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
That's not right.

264
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I gotta try that flounder sandwich.

265
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
I haven't tried it yet.

266
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,800
Knowing me I'd have to walk around with like a fucking 40 gallon trash bag attached to me

267
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,600
if I had a colostomy bag.

268
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,600
There's no.

269
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,080
I don't think I would fill that coin purse up pretty far you really only that you know

270
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,520
You think that there's poop inside of you all day, right? There's literally always poop inside of you. Yeah, but like

271
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,320
It's only enough for like one

272
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,080
One toilet full that's not true

273
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:40,160
You the poop it takes like it takes like sometimes 48 hours to like digest something fully from eating to pooping

274
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,960
I was going to say it sometimes takes you 48 hours to poop.

275
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I mean it can, but you always have 48 hours of poop in you.

276
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Really?

277
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah.

278
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,960
Is that what that movie is about?

279
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,960
Which one?

280
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Cheaper by the Dozen?

281
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,960
147 hours?

282
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,000
No, Cheaper by the... we already established.

283
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's about two hot momos.

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,920
What about Cheaper by the Dozen 127?

285
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,040
It's a family of climbers that get trapped.

286
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Oh.

287
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
It's a crossover.

288
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
I think there's a lot of...

289
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Movie 127.

290
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,040
Number seven.

291
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,040
Yeah.

292
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,720
I feel like we could do a bunch of crossovers with like number movies.

293
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Yeah.

294
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
That'd be big.

295
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Yeah.

296
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Number 23 by the dozen.

297
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Yeah.

298
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,640
Number 23 by the dozen would be really good.

299
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,640
Yeah.

300
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,640
It would be scary.

301
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,400
Because that's, you know, two dozen.

302
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,840
And then eventually, once we do like a bunch of cheaper by the, a bunch of the dozen saga,

303
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,520
then there can be like kind of like the infinity war and it's called like cheaper by the dozen

304
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,760
generations and it's like all the families in the same house.

305
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,560
every single family from every movie. It's called Dozen Annihilation. Dozens of Dozens.

306
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,400
Yeah. What? That could be one of them. Or it's like called like Dozens of Cheap Things.

307
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,320
It could be called like Dozens with a Z. Like the Z is really big. If I made that movie,

308
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,120
Cheap Brother Dozen, I would have called it my white ass family.

309
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,840
They're white as hell in that movie.

310
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,520
I call that crazy ass family and you know they white.

311
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
And you know they white.

312
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Remember they have that ginger kid?

313
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Yeah, they had two.

314
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Who's not white enough?

315
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Yeah, Steve Martin.

316
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
No, they had one ginger kid.

317
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
They had two.

318
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
They had twins.

319
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
FedEx.

320
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
They had twins.

321
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,440
It's called FedEx.

322
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,920
They did have a ginger girl, you're right.

323
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
They had the ginger twins.

324
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,680
But they picked on FedEx because he was more obsessed with toads than his family.

325
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,680
You know?

326
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,000
And apparently that's a crime in the Baker family.

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He was the one...

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,400
Was he the skater one?

329
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
No! He was the one who's a fucking nerd!

330
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,800
He looked like Jonathan Lipnicki!

331
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,500
Do I need to look up a...

332
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,800
a Dozens roster?

333
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Cheaper by the Dozen wiki.

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Cheaper by the Dozen wiki.

335
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,300
I don't think that's gonna exist.

336
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
It's gonna exist.

337
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,000
You think so?

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,400
There's somebody who is probably very

339
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,200
earnestly obsessed with those movies

340
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,700
in a very weird way.

341
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah, here it is.

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,300
Cheaper by the Dozen wiki.

343
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,400
Cheaper by the Dozen...

344
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,000
Cheapbythedozen.fandom.com

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,700
Couldn't even put the "er" in there?

346
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Let's see what the pages are. This wiki is a joke.

347
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Well it's okay, so it's just got pages for all the different family members.

348
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,700
Pages for the movies. Do they have any news on a sequel?

349
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Yeah, there's actually a cheaper by the dozen 2 which came out in 2005.

350
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Whoa!

351
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Believe it or not.

352
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
2005.

353
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,700
So I was wrong about every single trivia question.

354
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Cool.

355
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Well that was because of your concussion.

356
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Yeah.

357
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
I didn't know, I wasn't going to be like.

358
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,700
So all of them were trick questions and the answer was it actually came out in 2005.

359
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
I'm talking about the DVD release.

360
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Oh, okay.

361
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,200
It's a movie that came out in September, I believe.

362
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
There's a lot of pages on this.

363
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,700
Really? Is Hilary Duff in this movie?

364
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,700
I have a vague recollection of Hilary Duff being in this movie.

365
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,200
There is a Hilary Duff page on this wiki, let's see.

366
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
Okay.

367
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Hilary Erhard Duff is an American actress, singer, songwriter, designer, producer, and author.

368
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
Well, who would have guessed?

369
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Not me.

370
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,820
air last night at the bar when Hillary Duff showed up?

371
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,660
Yeah, when Hillary Duff, no, when that homeless lady was like, "Whoa."

372
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Oh yeah.

373
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,660
Were you there for that?

374
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,660
Yeah.

375
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
That was so fucking funny.

376
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
She walked in and stared at all of us at the table.

377
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,340
Okay, what happened was the homeless lady walked over to a group of people who were

378
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,980
smoking and then one lady, me, was like, me and Eamon were out there and we just saw this

379
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,560
lady be like, "Can I have some money?"

380
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,820
She did sound like Droopy Dog.

381
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
Yeah.

382
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,060
And then it was crazy how much she sounded like female Droopy Dog.

383
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,060
Insanely droopy.

384
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,980
this one girl was like, "Get the fuck out of here, you fucking bitch! You fucking stupid

385
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,620
bitch! Fuck you!" She was trying to fight her, and me and Eamon just couldn't stop laughing

386
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,540
because it was just like a homeless person asking for money.

387
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,900
Immediately, just a lady is like...

388
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
So then she walks into the bar.

389
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,140
She walks into the bar, yeah. She looks at me, like me, Patches, Cam, everyone who was

390
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,220
sitting there, and she's repeating herself, "You got any change? You got any change?"

391
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,700
And then the bartender was like get the fuck out of here.

392
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,020
Emily, she's like get the fuck out of here Emily.

393
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,220
And then three other people on the other side of the bar went Emily get the fuck out of here.

394
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,620
I mean it was the funniest thing I've ever seen.

395
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,540
Like an entire bar yelling at a homeless woman.

396
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,460
It's a world where like you don't even pretend to ignore homeless people you just actively

397
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,460
like.

398
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,860
I thought I slipped into a different reality.

399
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,380
I think one of them told Amon...

400
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,860
The girl outside who was screaming, who also was like celebrating after she left, she was

401
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,580
like, "Yeah, go on and fucking walk away from me, Emily, you stupid bitch!"

402
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,620
Called her a cunt, swear to God, it was fucking hilarious.

403
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,380
And then I was like, "Hey, that was cool that you yelled at that hobo."

404
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,300
And she was like, "Oh yeah, she like steals people's phones."

405
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Yeah.

406
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,700
So, it all had a happy ending.

407
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Nice.

408
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
It was said, Amon said that he heard she calls people the N-word.

409
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
Yeah, I heard she has two eyes.

410
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Yeah.

411
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
I heard that she has a lot of mental problems.

412
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
I heard she has a tail.

413
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,700
And is disenfranchised by society.

414
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Yeah.

415
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
I heard she used to be addicted to drugs, but she can't afford them now.

416
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Hmm.

417
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Yeah.

418
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
I found a very exciting page here on the cheaper, but less than wicked.

419
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I heard that she owns a Quiznos.

420
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,700
Wow.

421
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
I just heard that.

422
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I just got news from EmilyNews.com.

423
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
Oh, you're getting a report?

424
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I'm getting a report.

425
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
What's your report say?

426
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,420
It says she sucked my dick.

427
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,420
Whoa!

428
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,420
Yep.

429
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,420
Hold on.

430
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,420
I got laid.

431
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Is that?

432
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,660
Here, I'm getting a report.

433
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,100
She touched my balls too.

434
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,100
Whoa!

435
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,100
Sources are saying she touched.

436
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
That's true.

437
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
Who's your source?

438
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Where's the report coming from?

439
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,640
It's coming from my earpiece right now.

440
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Your earpiece?

441
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Is your earpiece linked up to emilynews.com?

442
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,620
It is a red alert.

443
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,980
It's actually, people are...

444
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:41,740
Okay, my source is saying I've had sex with all the girls in the world.

445
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,740
Whoa.

446
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,060
Even your mom?

447
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,260
Sources are saying no, not my mom.

448
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,980
are saying well my source says that you had sex with your own mom well yeah my

449
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,980
sources are every every so is your mom not a girl and your grandma - sorry and

450
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,180
all of your aunts sources are saying that and your cousin

451
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,100
sources are saying that second cousins who were feeling all your great

452
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,140
grandmothers guys the feeds really scrambled right now I can't get a clear I

453
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,900
think there's kind of too many saying this saying different things looked up

454
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,700
girl named Kayla Bina sources are saying that one's true I fucked Kayla Bina yeah

455
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,160
who's also bald. The sources are saying she has beautiful long hair. She has beautiful

456
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,820
long hair down there. Oh wow this is coming in right now. This is coming in right now.

457
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,420
And by down there I mean the legs. Okay all right this is coming in right now. This is

458
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,780
a little bit of a clarification on the story. So apparently it's it's it's all

459
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:39,620
I only had sex with your moms. No. According to my sources. You had sex with every woman in the

460
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,580
world including your grandpa. No apparently it was a bit of a editor is

461
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,980
making a note for me. That it was correct. That it was wrong actually.

462
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,980
That it was correct. Oh I just got a million dollars also. I just got a report that that

463
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,220
story has received six Pinocchios. It's more than more Pinocchios. It seems like the story...

464
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,700
There's a five Pinocchios scale. Oh wow this is interesting. It seems like there's actually...

465
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,060
so there's actually a character called Reverse Pinocchio whose nose goes inside

466
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,460
when he tells the truth and I'm getting sources that are saying that the story

467
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,380
actually got five reverse Pinocchios. Five reverse Pinocchios on PinocchioNews.com.

468
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,620
So I'm getting some Pinocchio news. Apparently Pinocchio is in the belly of a whale.

469
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:26,460
No! Last seen. I thought he got out.

470
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,620
Seems like he's there again. Is he real yet?

471
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,620
Let's see. Sources are saying that he's not real yet, but he is currently in the belly

472
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,180
of a whale. Well this is crazy news, because earlier I

473
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,300
I heard that Pinocchio was turned into a braying jackass.

474
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,300
No.

475
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Yeah.

476
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
Wait, I'm getting a report.

477
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,340
Oh wow, he's more than braying, he's ornery, they say.

478
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Whoa.

479
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
Yeah.

480
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:56,020
But he said that, but I heard that the curse was actually reversed, but his two friends

481
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
I'm getting that too.

482
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,940
His two friends who taught him swearing were turned into braying jackasses.

483
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,460
Yeah, yeah, I'm getting the exact same.

484
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,860
I actually, I received a report too that that scared me a lot when that happened.

485
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm receiving a report that actually I'm being, I'm actually being scared even just thinking

486
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,800
about it because of how many bad memories I have.

487
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,140
I am, I am receiving a report though that I'm rather intrigued and wish to return to

488
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,840
the scene as an adult to see whether it still scares me.

489
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:27,540
I'm getting a report here and I mean this could be a typo but it just says uh, hee haw,

490
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:30,000
hee haw.

491
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,780
I will say you're kind of revealing your sources here.

492
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,780
Heehaw.

493
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,780
Heehaw.

494
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,540
Can we just, you know what, split the screen.

495
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,060
Can we just get one of these braying jackasses on the phone?

496
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
Okay.

497
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Alright.

498
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,540
I'm here with a braying jackass.

499
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,780
Jackass, how are you today?

500
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,780
Heehaw.

501
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,780
Very interesting.

502
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:56,900
Now what do you have to say about reports that Pinocchio is in the belly of a whale?

503
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,340
Haw.

504
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,580
Heehaw.

505
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,060
And it seems like that's all the time we have.

506
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,900
I'm splitting the screen again over your interview.

507
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,900
This is ridiculous.

508
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
This guy clearly has nothing to say.

509
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Listen, can we just be civil, guys?

510
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
He calls himself a journalist.

511
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
He's literally a brain jackass.

512
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,900
Hold on now, hold on now.

513
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Getting reports that the whale has sneezed.

514
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Huh, I'm getting reports there's something in the sky.

515
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Oh, I'm getting reports that it's getting closer.

516
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,900
And there it is. That's Pinocchio.

517
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,900
He actually landed safely.

518
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:37,500
safely. Everybody at the office is cheering. We're all doing great now. And

519
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,800
that's all for us. I'm Caleb Beena Pitts. Have a wonderful night.

520
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,800
We should just move into news. I think we'd be some good newsmen.

521
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,700
It'd be the most amazing. We could do crazy stuff. I have some news for you.

522
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,900
Oh yeah, we still haven't read this cheaper news. Cheaper news coming in.

523
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:03,780
I'm getting a report. I'm receiving a report from from the dozen actually

524
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,780
Oh

525
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:11,700
apparently chandelier. I'm hearing that the chandelier was a prominent

526
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,980
lightning fixture that first appeared in cheaper by the dozen. It was located in

527
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,860
the Baker family's new mansion in a Chicago suburb and was infamous because

528
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:26,380
it crashed several times to the floor as a result of various mishaps. Wow wow wow

529
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,700
and that's some hard-hitting journalism.

530
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,960
- Well, this just in.

531
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,800
- Oh.

532
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,940
- This just in, we're hearing from Tom Baker here.

533
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,460
I have some information about Tom Baker.

534
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,380
- Tom Baker?

535
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,300
- Thomas Tom Baker, born October 27th, 1953,

536
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,780
is the father of 12 children and husband to Kate Baker.

537
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:46,500
Tom grew up in a large family.

538
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,620
And now I'm seeing, I have an,

539
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,540
there's an info box popping up on the screen.

540
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,940
A wiki-style info box. - I see it, yeah.

541
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,860
- Yeah, you can see here, it says, "Status alive."

542
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,560
it says well i think that is always good romances kate baker wife love his life

543
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,400
and it says that there's also the final category as you can see here on your

544
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:08,480
screen is in fact loyalty uh... he has to loyalties which are to the baker family

545
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,100
and the profession of being a football coach currently

546
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,320
wow

547
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,300
wow while i'm also i think you know just

548
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,980
before you know before you have to cut the commercial at one more tidbit about

549
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,900
tom here

550
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,840
tom baker is also the insulin waiter from jim henson's the muppet movie when

551
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,600
Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy went out for dinner. In that scene from the Muppet movie,

552
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Tom Baker had a sip of the wine and spit and then said, "Excellent choice," in a beautiful

553
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,560
voice that sounds like Bing Crosby's voice.

554
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,960
Wow. And on a lighter note...

555
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,040
What? Are they connecting?

556
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:45,520
On a bit of a lighter note, we have in the studio with us a very sad mouse. Mouse, how are you today?

557
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,520
And that's just horrible to hear. Back to you, Cameron.

558
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,720
I don't have anything else. Cut to commercial. Now.

559
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:04,320
Are you tired of sucking? Do you want to be better? Try out my drink.

560
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Hi, I'm Todd Bosley, inventor of that drink. And I put a bunch of pills in a blender and with fruit.

561
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,760
And this could actually make your life better and make you much stronger.

562
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,440
And it put acai berries in it?

563
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,760
I'm allergic to acai berries. Oh no, my throat's closing up.

564
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,360
That's the announcer of the commercial and I should have told him that before.

565
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,520
Hi, I'm Dr. Monster. Have you been- have you received side effects as a- as an effect of

566
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,960
the drink that was on the last commercial just now? You may even be entitled to

567
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,880
nothing. It's still part of the last commercial. Fuck you.

568
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,240
I can't believe Dr. Monster bought ad space in my ad.

569
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:56,920
And we're back and we're receiving reports that celebrity doctor, Dr. Monster is actually going to jail for being too weird.

570
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,920
Yeah, this is actually a very interesting development because many people thought that he was too cool to go to jail.

571
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,420
Yeah.

572
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:07,420
But it seems like the courts have finally changed their mind.

573
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:15,420
This just in, actually, this is actually just continuing on their story. My bad. I thought it was breaking news, but it wasn't.

574
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,420
You're our worst newsman.

575
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:23,380
I'm new to the job. Dr. Monster was deemed too cool to go to jail after giving

576
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:28,100
Michael Jackson all those prescriptions that killed him. People were very

577
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,700
excited once Dr. Monster killed Michael Jackson and he also went on to kill many

578
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,860
other people with prescription drugs including Prince. I'm getting reports

579
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,220
that Dr. Monster hmm yeah like I thought he's behind Mac Miller and Little Peep as

580
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:51,340
well. Yep, I've actually just received a second report confirming that and adding

581
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,420
Epton Yelchin to the list. Yep, I'm getting reports of that as well. Oh, I'm

582
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,260
seeing pictures of him attacking Juice WRLD. Oh wow. Yeah, so it seems like

583
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,780
federal investigators were able to put this together by all the the the giant

584
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,100
claw marks on each and every one of these deceased bodies. Matching the claws

585
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,260
of one doctor monster that's a great that's great well breaking this just in

586
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,400
Nora is 22 years old as honey blonde hair with sunny highlights she has a

587
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,180
boyfriend named Hank who her younger siblings do not like Wow I'm getting

588
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,300
this in right now I'm Wow so apparently according to my sources I'm imagining

589
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:35,620
Nora in a bikini hmm my wow my source here is saying that in cheaper by the

590
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,060
dozen too. Nora is pregnant and is played by Piper Perabo. I'm getting reports that

591
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,160
her being pregnant is only making me more attracted to her. So that's an

592
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,720
interesting unexpected development on my end. I'm getting reports here my sources

593
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,680
are saying that Caleb is imagining pregnant, what was her, Nora bobbing up and

594
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,960
down in a swimming pool on her pregnant belly. I'm hearing that too. I'm also

595
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I'm also getting reports that my boner got so big it's in my mouth now.

596
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,800
And it's out.

597
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,000
There's a...

598
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,120
Well I'm very glad to hear that. That could have been a dangerous situation.

599
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,920
We're going to ask the audience

600
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,760
what they think of this and

601
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,240
I have a message here from user Caleb

602
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,880
and it says that

603
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,880
Oh, oh man, I'm imagining feeding Nora a Jimmy John's sub while she's bobbing up and down in the pool on her pregnant belly.

604
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,880
I'm seeing another comment here that actually from the audience, it's from a user cpits, and it says,

605
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,880
"I wish that I could bob for Nora like an apple on Halloween day."

606
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,880
I'm seeing reports that I made both of those comments.

607
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,880
Very impressive work, boys.

608
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,880
There's one more here from Cpits8baller.

609
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:17,040
"Oooowee, I wish I could hit her pregnant belly with a pool cue and watch her spin around

610
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:24,320
on a pool table hitting the 8 ball into the corner pocket just like Super Monkey Ball pool."

611
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,520
And here's actually a follow-up comment to that, a reply by the same user right under it that also says

612
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
"I would love to hit her belly like a gong"

613
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:40,320
And there's an added thing to that thread that says "I don't even care if there's a baby in it"

614
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,560
No pat

615
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:49,760
I'm seeing reports that I'm developing a sexual fetish for pregnant women who actually don't have a baby in there

616
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,920
That's what it says on the teleprompter

617
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,600
So if you or a loved one knows of any pregnant women who quote unquote

618
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,840
don't have a baby in there, please call the toll-free number on your screen.

619
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,800
There's a... It's my number. It's 911.

620
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,680
Doing a cursory glance through CPIT's 8BALA's page...

621
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Oh, I'm seeing reports that you should not do that.

622
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:18,880
It appears that he hasn't unlinked his Amazon account to his account,

623
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,760
and he has just purchased a fake pregnant belly.

624
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,880
Wow, I'm actually getting reports that upon purchasing the fake pregnant belly, I'm getting so horny that even my balls are hard.

625
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,480
Wow, I've actually seen a report just now that he's made another purchase right after the pregnant belly, and it seems to be a full-length mirror. How strange.

626
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:47,080
Wow, he's-- oh, this is interesting. So apparently, I'm researching cloning and whether or not I could go to Indonesia and have it done for $600.

627
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:50,220
And there's one more Amazon purchase here and uh...

628
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,120
Seems to be a $20,000 ultrasound machine

629
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:00,120
and 600 ounces of ultrasound gel.

630
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,880
Ah, okay, this is making more and more sense as we piece this together.

631
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:10,420
It appears that I think that ultrasound gel tastes like candy.

632
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,120
Yeah, there's another post here by Cpitz8bala that says

633
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,920
"Ooo-ee-oo, I wish Haribo would turn this ultrasound jelly into candy."

634
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,080
I'm seeing actually another purchase here.

635
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,520
It's actually a video rental online for Star Wars Episode II, Attack of the Clones,

636
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,320
and I am seeing a cancelled plane ticket to Indonesia as well.

637
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,040
Oh, okay. Alright.

638
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,960
Well, this is actually taking a turn for the worse, this story, I would say.

639
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,600
Apparently, I just imagined a pregnant woman pooping and got a little movement down there.

640
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,160
It seems like this could be big trouble.

641
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,880
And doing another cursory glance through C-Pit's 8-Ballers thing, his posts.

642
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,160
Oh, it appears that I got another movement when Patrick said that he was looking at my thing.

643
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,480
Another cursory glance through C-Pit's 8-Ballers account says here,

644
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,440
"Damn, what if a pregnant lady could poop out the baby then put it back?"

645
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,440
That's foul. That is, that is uh, that's horrible. You know what?

646
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,440
Insanely disgusting person. And to me for the sports. Welcome to the sports segment.

647
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,440
I, today is basketball, NBA debut. Okay, so basically. Don't let this guy look at a basketball.

648
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:38,440
Basically the basketballs are so beautiful when they have a child in them and they are attached to a blonde woman

649
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:43,080
and there's a ch- and a ch- and the beautiful milk is coming out of them.

650
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:50,160
And there's basically every ball is beautiful and big and the- and I- and I'm-

651
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,440
um, back to the news.

652
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,680
This just in, Caleb has been fired from the news.

653
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,800
This just in, guys I'm calling you from a cellular telephone.

654
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,760
Apparently I've been fired for trying to finger myself at the desk.

655
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:11,780
Caleb has been trying to Caleb has been fired from the news and in an unexpected turn of events

656
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,780
He has been hired at the beach ball store

657
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:21,960
Guys I'm live from the beach ball store. I've been duct-taping all the beach balls to myself him in I don't know why

658
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,840
Our connection is like this is like in the Batman movie when they had the Joker on TV

659
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,040
Hmm. I'm getting reports that the Batman movie is actually very good. We actually got that report. Are we talking about?

660
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,200
I'm getting a report that the best one is Dark Knight. I also got that report.

661
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,680
We can't say that yet. Oh wow, I'm getting a report. Wow.

662
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,440
I can't say that yet, there's a new one coming out soon. Wow, I mean this is a truly big story.

663
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,640
Apparently, Dr. Monster also had something to do with Heath Ledger's death.

664
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,960
Really? Oh yep, and Elliot Smith. And Elliot Smith. Yep. Well I guess that makes

665
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,360
sense there was a lot of people forget there was a giant claw found in Elliot

666
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,200
Smith's chest. Many people thought that he stabbed himself with the claw mm-hmm

667
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,120
and I always thought that made no sense. No, he doesn't have claws. Yeah. Exactly

668
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,760
how could he have done it? Yeah. Wasn't him. I do think his wife did that though. Yeah. Do you

669
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,400
think that? I don't know too much. I don't know anything about it. I know that he got

670
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,280
stabbed in the heart. He either got murdered or just was like the

671
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,520
coolest shit ever where you just like a samurai just stab yourself. Yeah. What do you guys

672
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,160

681
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,080
- "Lake of Fire"?

682
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,920
- Yeah.

683
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,740
- I thought it was a Nirvana song.

684
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,580
- Yeah, you're a piece of shit.

685
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,420
- Jesus, Jesus don't want me.

686
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,520
- Sorry, I like cool music and not stupid music.

687
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,840
- Me Puppets way cooler than Nirvana.

688
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,240
- Me Puppets is so sick.

689
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,080
- I don't know what that is.

690
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,920
- You ever heard that song?

691
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,740
- I don't like rock.

692
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,580
- You ever heard that song?

693
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,820
Oh fuck.

694
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,000
'Cause they have a song called,

695
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,700
I always forget the name of it,

696
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,640
but they have a song called "The Whistling Song".

697
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,480
- Mm-hmm.

698
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,300
- And then there's the other one.

699
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,140
- Oh, I've heard that one, it goes like.

700
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,480
(whistling)

701
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,800
(whistling)

702
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,800
- I love it when Me Puppets, they put like three songs

703
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,560
on the same album that have the same name.

704
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,400
- Yeah.

705
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
- That's such a sick thing to do.

706
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,880
- I think that's a bad thing to do.

707
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,720
- It's awesome.

708
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,920
- Well, how's that a good thing to do?

709
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,760
- It's funny.

710
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,920
- What if we named three episodes in a row the same thing?

711
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,760
- Yeah, what if we named the episode "Boo"?

712
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
- Hmm.

713
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,600
How about "Beautiful Pregnant Woman"?

714
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,640
Pregnant Caleb.

715
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,920
Caleb got pregnant.

716
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,560
Caleb got himself pregnant.

717
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,200
You can maybe make your own thing and call it that.

718
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,960
I'm not, I don't, I'm not unattracted to pregnant women.

719
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,080
I guess, I mean, that's probably good for you.

720
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,080
Why for me?

721
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:34,440
If, you know, you ever get your wife pregnant.

722
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,640
I can get my wife pregnant, you're right.

723
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
Oh my god, that's huge.

724
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,400
I think it's Maiden's Milk by the Meat Puppets, it's the whistling song.

725
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,120
I thought you said it was called the whistling song.

726
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:50,760
No, there's another song called the whistling song but that made its milk is the one where they whistle where it's uh

727
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,240
Yeah, there's a lot of whistling in it

728
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:56,440
That's got to be one of the most boring things i've ever heard

729
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,160
What oh

730
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,560
I just got breaking news. Uh

731
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,960
Pinocchio has been turned into a real boy. Oh my god last wow

732
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,040
I'm getting this exact same news from my sources.

733
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,040
I actually am getting a similar story that apparently Jonathan David Bennett, who played

734
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,020
Bud McNulty in 2005's Cheaper by the Dozen 2, was also the host of the Food Network series

735
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,960
Halloween Wars.

736
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,440
Are you also getting this news from Geppetto?

737
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Yep.

738
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Wow.

739
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,480
He's a bit of a Dozen head.

740
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,400
I've heard Geppetto is a huge fan of Cheaper by the Dozen.

741
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,400
As well as Halloween Wars.

742
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:45,120
I'm getting reports, and this is interesting, that Halloween Wars is actually very scary.

743
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,280
And it's happening soon, on the 31st.

744
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,760
Okay, I'm getting reports, I'm still in the beach ball store by the way, I'm getting reports

745
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,960
that I'm very scared of Halloween Wars.

746
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,480
It seems as if it's a war where whoever wins, we lose.

747
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,520
I am getting a report from Geppetto that each episode does have two rounds which consist

748
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,400
of the small scare and the spine chiller.

749
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,280
Wow, I'm getting reports from Japano who is the Japanese Geppetto and...

750
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:34,760
Yeah I will not be saying that on air.

751
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:39,440
Japanese Japetto dude. Oh man. He makes like a, he makes a little pup, what are those called?

752
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,520
Those little puppets? You know those little Japanese puppets? Oh, Bunraku. Mannequin. Bunraku?

753
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,160
Bunraku. Those things are cool as fuck. They're so scary. They're really cool, yeah. You've

754
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,440
never seen Bunraku? No. It's basically like a, an evil kind of, Bakugan is actually what

755
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm thinking of. Yeah, the ancient Japanese art of Bakugan. Check this out. What's thisly?

756
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,740
the Halloween Wars logo.

757
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,500
Halloween Wars, the screams do come true.

758
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,820
Fuck that's scary.

759
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
What do they do in Halloween Wars?

760
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
It's two cupcakes.

761
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,820
Oh, oh.

762
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,820
Two cupcakes.

763
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,820
That's the one where they make scary cakes?

764
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,420
Yeah, it's just Cake Wars, but for Halloween.

765
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,140
That actually, I did watch it one time and it was more scary than I thought.

766
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,420
They did some scary cakes.

767
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,900
Cake Wars is such a funny show because they have that one, they have one judge who's like

768
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:25,060
an old Israeli guy who's just like incredibly catty and mean to everybody.

769
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,060
Oh yeah, that guy is crazy.

770
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
He's like a chef.

771
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
He's so funny.

772
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
Is that one?

773
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:36,020
I think it's Zohan. Yeah. Yeah, his name is Ron Ben Israel. No way. Yeah, that's true.

774
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,740
He's Ben Israel. This whole time. He's Ben Israel.

775
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:44,900
Yeah, he but he's just he's always like the taste is disgusting

776
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,620
Plus it's scary. Yeah, but it's way too scary.

777
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:55,620
Well, yeah, they didn't have him on Halloween Wars. I'm sure. Because he's too scared. Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's scared of everyday life

778
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:00,780
That's why that's why he's rude to everybody. He's afraid of being unwanted

779
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:06,120
He's a friend. That's why and that's why he lashes out on people's cakes. Why is there not a scary?

780
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:12,780
I've been thinking about this for a while. There should be a horror movie where the villain stop right there. I'm already too scared

781
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,860
Start right there. Okay, there should be backup

782
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:24,800
There should be a horror movie where the villain is actually somebody's maybe depression or anxiety that could whoa

783
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
What do you think about that?

784
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,780
It would be a little too scary because it's kind of too relatable in real world terms.

785
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:37,020
Like maybe like a movie about where the villain, where the monster is OCD?

786
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,060
Yeah, so maybe like it's Chucky, right?

787
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,060
Right.

788
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,100
And Chucky kills like a million people and then at the end somebody like, somebody is

789
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,300
like smiles for the first time ever and Chucky kind of disappears.

790
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,460
Right.

791
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,820
Would that be good?

792
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
That could be really good.

793
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,340
Maybe a Kaiju movie where the real Godzilla was my depression.

794
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:06,220
Or maybe a Kaiju movie where he gets in trouble for not cleaning up his toys.

795
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,580
I'll call my agent for pinching his baby sister.

796
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:16,180
Oh, I'm getting reports here, Kaiju has been grounded for pinching his baby sister twice.

797
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:21,820
I actually did, I did receive a breaking report right now and this is something that, you

798
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:30,220
You know I'm a little, I'm loath to say on air but, Mommy Duck, angry on Tom.

799
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,980
Oh the humanity.

800
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:40,220
And apparently, Ducker was part of the situation as well.

801
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:45,580
And there are reports, I mean there are millions of reports coming in, I'm looking through

802
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:51,260
social media here seeing people say that Ducker saw Goober.

803
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:55,620
Apparently Ducker saw Goober and then Goober went around.

804
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,980
Wow, wow.

805
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
I'm getting...

806
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,620
Wow, this is just coming in right now.

807
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,860
Bear with us.

808
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,420
I'm getting reports that Goober was here.

809
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:15,620
Apparently Ducker went to the restaurant, ordered food, ate, paid, left, and went.

810
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,060
And was Ducker at the restaurant?

811
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:20,740
I'm getting reports that that in fact has been ascertained to be the case.

812
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,080
He was last seen leaving the restaurant.

813
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:26,800
Oh wow, apparently he's now on the road.

814
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,800
Ducker's on the road.

815
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,740
Ducker is on the road.

816
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:34,700
Now let's just pray for us and everyone there at home that he doesn't run into Goober again.

817
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:38,820
And we're seeing Goober driving a white 1994 Ford Bronco.

818
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:39,980
Wow.

819
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,980
Down the highway.

820
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,460
I'm getting a report that the nation of North Korea has launched a ballistic missile at

821
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,300
the United States.

822
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,440
Breaking news!

823
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,760
Goober just saw Ducker again.

824
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,960
This is the most important story in centuries.

825
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,220
We have someone live on the ground with Ducker and Goober.

826
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,040
Let's cut to you, Dave.

827
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Hey there, Caleb.

828
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,160
Yeah, I'm here with Ducker and Goober.

829
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,360
Well that's great, Dave.

830
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:13,040
So what are, what are, what are, what's up with these two guys?

831
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,620
Well it appears they actually saw each other earlier today.

832
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
Well that's very...

833
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,620
That's very nice.

834
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,620
I'm getting reports here that uh...

835
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Why don't you set up yourself as two different people if you're just gonna...

836
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,620
Oh, I'm getting reports that there's actually a pregnant woman right next to me.

837
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:39,620
Hey Caleb! It's me and I'm pregnant! And there's no baby in there.

838
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,620
I'm getting reports that that is officially awesome.

839
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:49,020
Now, I'm getting reports that Caleb was so horny that he saw a beach ball and he thought it was a woman.

840
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,060
I'm getting the same reports actually.

841
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,260
This beach ball next to me...

842
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,540
Well, let's just say it's in no shape to be returned.

843
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,300
So if anybody would like a free beach ball, you're more than welcome.

844
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,380
And that's the news, ladies and gentlemen.

845
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:09,020
I'm getting reports in...

846
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,980
Jerry with the brain.

847
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:16,100
Jerry was with the brain. He was with the brain. Somebody should have stopped him.

848
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:20,380
True. But you know Tom was busy.

849
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:25,300
Mommy Duck angry at Tom. Those Tom and Jerry pages

850
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,500
have been... What? Those Tom and Jerry pages. What are you talking about?

851
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,460
Where they talk about like laughing Tom. I have no idea what you're talking about.

852
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:36,940
So Mommy Duck was... We're talking about something different. Yeah well

853
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,580
anyway I mean we didn't talk that much about Mommy Duck angry at Tom. Sure. We were just talking about that for a little while.

854
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,580
Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I mean

855
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,520
What you know, yeah, well, I'm Tommy Duck

856
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:56,180
Happy on true on bun buck buck. Yeah buck mom. Yeah, there's one of the schizophrenic episodes

857
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:03,920
I've ever done Jesus. I feel crazy right now. I'm not recovered from my injury. No, definitely not. I need a bandage

858
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:09,040
For again, you already got one on your head. I just want a big mummy bandage around my head

859
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,760
Yeah, you want to wrap you would that be offensive if I was a toilet paper mummy for Christmas or Halloween for Christmas?

860
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,760
Yes, it would be offensive

861
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:24,920
Yeah, I have the top review of Halloween Wars here on IMDB do you know I do it's a one-star review one out of

862
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:28,400
What are they saying the subject line is ruined it?

863
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:38,840
The one holiday show I looked forward to has now been ruined where are the pumpkin carvers

864
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Sorry, not watching this season.

865
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,840
The Pumpkin Carvers.

866
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,840
They got rid of the Pumpkin Carvers on Halloween Awards.

867
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
No, say it ain't so, dude.

868
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,840
Oh, Jesus.

869
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
Here's a 5 out of 10 review.

870
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,840
The host is awful, over the top, loud, and annoying.

871
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,840
Do they think toddlers watch this?

872
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,840
Replace the fast-paced nonsense with more adult content and I'd really like this show.

873
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,840
That still gets 5 stars?

874
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:02,840
I guess.

875
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Congratulations, you killed your own show.

876
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,840
your own show you took away the pumpkin carving your place everyone's so mad

877
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:13,040
there's Carla already did that and did it better I've watched ten seasons some

878
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,040
more than once but I'm done with you until you bring back carving you also cut

879
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:22,080
the price in half while making more advertising dollar and your host sucks

880
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,600
damn people really are mad about Halloween Wars yeah maybe I'll get into

881
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:32,520
baking cake pull that up I just need it I need a new hobby with my hand you

882
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,720
You should get into making beef jerky.

883
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,520
Dude, no way.

884
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,720
Why did you say it like that?

885
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,720
Because I'm not going to have my fucking house smell like beef jerky all the fucking time.

886
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:47,020
You could make like teriyaki jerky or like...

887
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,820
I know that I can make teriyaki...

888
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:50,820
I know I can pepper the jerky.

889
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:52,920
I don't know how you would make Korean barbecue jerky.

890
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,020
That doesn't make any sense.

891
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,320
Gochujang or something.

892
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,720
It's probably the same deal as teriyaki jerky.

893
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:04,600
I am not gonna live in a world where I walk into my house every single day and I get scared by a piece of beef.

894
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:08,340
Get scared? You don't have to get scared by it. It's gonna be in a smoker in your living room.

895
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,140
I'm gonna forget that it's there!

896
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,180
No, you just put it in a dehydrator.

897
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,380
I don't have a dehydrator, you idiot!

898
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:19,480
Oh my, I'm telling you, just get one or something. Or maybe put it in the oven for like...

899
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,080
How about this? What if I make a beef jerky cake? Doesn't that make way more sense? Make a piece of cake?

900
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,400
So like a savory cake?

901
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,000
No, it just looks like beef jerky.

902
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,080
Oh, so it's like one of those damn things that you cut into and then snap, it's cake.

903
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,680
I think I'm going to start doing that.

904
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,680
Yeah.

905
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,680
Yeah.

906
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,680
Yeah.

907
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,680
It'll be fun.

908
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,680
I really defied that.

909
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,680
I try to do that just horrible at it.

910
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,920
It's like, "Is this a tissue box or a cake?"

911
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,760
It's just like a pile of bread.

912
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:46,760
It looks like a gray blob.

913
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
You'll never guess.

914
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,200
You cut into it and it's just the most beautiful marbled cake.

915
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,280
Just sending pictures of my butthole to celebrities and when they ask, "Why did you send me a picture

916
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,280
of your butthole?"

917
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,280
I'm like, "It's actually cake."

918
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,280
It's cake.

919
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,920
negative you'd like to cut into it's just cake unless you find it unless you

920
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,000
think that it's a very clean butthole in that case it's my butthole but if you

921
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,280
don't if you see poop it's cake remember when Trisha Paytas posted like a picture

922
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,520
of her butthole and there's like a bunch of toilet paper on it no I remember that

923
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,920
do you yeah does she do naked stuff she did I don't think she does anymore but I

924
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,120
know she's good for her she get into Christianity or something she got into

925
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,880
Judaism. Wow that's like kind of Christian, that's like diet Christianity. She either married her,

926
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,080

927
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,960
seen the woman's asshole. I'm familiar enough, I know that that was one of the big thing because

928
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,920

Zoo she belongs in a zoo

no there's a Jew inside of her and it's her husband

947
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,880
No, she should be in a thing.

948
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,160
She should be in a...

949
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,200
She should be in a thing.

950
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,720
What's a word that isn't camp?

951
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,720
A fucking enclosure.

952
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,400
Enclosure.

953
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,080
She should be in a zoo enclosure.

954
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,360
Fucking piece of shit.

955
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:09,920
What?

956
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,040
See, I literally...

957
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,160
I almost said encampment.

958
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,840
I was like, that's a bad look.

959
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,000
She should be in an enclosure with a bunch of gorillas.

960
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,080
You know what?

961
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:19,200
That honestly...

962
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:19,920
Will she like...

963
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:28,860
like like those uh fucking gorilla like puppets you know like the what's the

964
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:35,280
word I'm looking for and metamorphic the massive fucking AI gorillas hey I

965
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,760
gorillas oh oh the ones that like the ones from Fallout 4 what you know the

966
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,520
synthetic gorillas no from Fallout 4 I never played you never went into the

967
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,980
Institute huh I've never played Fallout 4 I never played Fallout 4 either it's

968
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:52,620
fine yeah it is a track they should sell more video games in Boston there's so

969
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,500
many Boston movies they make it so you can walk from fucking Concord all the way to Fenway

970
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,300
yeah Boston is like this big in the game yeah there's also you say there's a lot of

971
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,900
Boston movies there's not enough Boston movies there's more Boston movies than

972
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:08,820
most other cities yeah but there's not enough Boston movies every you're right

973
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:13,300
every movie should be set in Boston pretty much with with Donnie Wahlberg no

974
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,700
I've heard of the neighborhood where he lives the tagline of Southie is the most

975
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,980
dangerous neighborhood in the world. The Southie Project? Yeah. Yeah I think that

976
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:28,780
they should do like, I knew all more Boston romantic comedies. Oh like Fever

977
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:33,660
Pitch? Fever Pitch was a perfect movie. So good. Jimmy Fallon and Drew

978
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:38,340
Barrymore. Why Jimmy Fallon stopped doing all the movies man? He was crushing. He

979
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:42,860
was on TV. He was way better at acting than he is at doing that job. Yeah

980
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,660
Yeah, because he has multiple takes and it's not live so you can't see him just go like

981
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:47,660
"eh, eh"

982
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,660
Like a baby.

983
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,660
Don't you dare talk about Jimmy Fallon.

984
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:51,660
"Eh"

985
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,660
He does that on purpose on TV though.

986
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:54,660
That's not-

987
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:56,660
Yeah, I can't imagine laughing on purpose.

988
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,660
Goddamn, fuck that guy.

989
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,660
Yeah, aw, that piece of shit.

990
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,660
His laugh is so fake.

991
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Oh, man.

992
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,660
[laughter]

993
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,660
What, it was funny?

994
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,660
That was pretty funny.

995
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,300
That was pretty good. What about Jimmy Fallon? That was a good laugh.

996
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,660
I sabotage every one of my own bits by laughing.

997
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:23,660
What? No, go ahead, Pat.

998
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:28,660
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee

999
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:31,660
hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee

1000
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:33,660
What is that noise, dude?

1001
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,660
Dude, dude!

1002
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:41,660

00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,660
Yeah.

1004
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,660
That's how it feels most of the time we're here.

1005
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:49,660
This is the, this is the, you know, we had our sleepy summer episodes.

00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:50,660
It is getting darker in here.

1007
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,660
This is our falling asleep fall.

1008
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,660
It's true, it's darker earlier.

1009
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,660
Yeah, that is true.

1010
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,660
Oh, that's why it's getting darker in here.

1011
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:00,660
We're going from sleepy summer to weary winter is the problem.

00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:41,120
Can we just have one romantic night soon, yeah, can we just us three have a romantic night?

1031
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,820
We have to do that if you guys showed up - all right, honestly, if you have had on a date a few months ago

1032
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:51,660
go by accident. Oh yeah. I still remember we went to that Vibes restaurant. Oh you

1033
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:57,100
went to Cream. Yeah we went on a date. So can I give one of you a date?

1034
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,820
It's been a while since date night. Yeah we've been we've we've done it before we've we

1035
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,260
both have. I've never been on a date with you. I don't think you two have. You may have

1036
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,860
been on a date? We've definitely gone to places. Where? Where did we go on a date?

1037
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,940
Probably went to a bar. That's not a date. Probably went to a bar. Me and

1038
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:18,740
Caleb will probably... Me and Caleb had more... Me and Caleb had some breakfast dates.

1039
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:20,980
Yeah, which are casual though. It doesn't mean much.

1040
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:22,180
Yeah, casual dates. Yeah.

1041
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:23,700
Might as well need a fancy date.

1042
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,740
Yeah, we used to be breakfast buddies.

1043
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,740
Mhmm. Breakfast bruddies.

1044
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,500
We used to be the breakfast bruhs.

1045
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,700
We used to be breakfast bruhs.

1046
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,300
I used to look at my breakfast and say, "Bruh, breakfast."

1047
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,380
That's the problem with Cam. He's not a night owl at all.

1048
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,180
What do you mean?

1049
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,340
He's not any kind of owl. The man's a fucking human.

1050
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,260
You stay up till like 5am.

1051
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:46,060
It's not that I'm not a night owl.

1052
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:46,900
I go to bed at like 2.

1053
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,100
You're like an early morning owl.

1054
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,220
You, you don't, you can't, in relation to you,

1055
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,900
yeah, I go to bed pretty early,

1056
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:57,300
but I don't think that counts for much.

1057
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:59,860
You don't stay out too much late, right?

1058
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:00,700
Not really.

1059
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,660
You're usually the one that goes home first, I think.

1060
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,340
I don't think that's necessarily true.

1061
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,940
I think I usually go home when other people do.

1062
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,780
I used to be.

1063
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,620
It used to be that.

1064
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,540
Well yeah, because I lived an hour away.

1065
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,380
That's true.

1066
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,780
I'm staying out past like midnight now.

1067
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:14,980
I fucking hate it, dude.

1068
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,980
I like it.

1069
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,300
I fucking, I hate it.

1070
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,060
I fucking hate it.

1071
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,900
I fucking hate it!

1072
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,860
I love spending like $600 to get home.

1073
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:25,860
Yeah.

1074
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:27,580
Guess how much my Uber home was last night?

1075
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:28,580
How much?

1076
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,580
Eight bucks.

1077
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,580
Really?

1078
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,580
Guess how much my, uh, how, Zero, I walked.

1079
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,580
Me too.

1080
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,580
Nothing.

1081
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:35,580
I walked.

1082
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,580
I'm sorry, but I like to be manly.

1083
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,580
That's probably pretty much treated like a king.

1084
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,580
Like a mile away, though.

1085
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:39,580
What?

1086
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:40,580
From where, that bar to my house?

1087
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,580
Yeah, after I took the Uber, I was like, "That's stupid."

1088
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:44,580
Yeah, I don't know why I took that.

1089
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,580
I was like, "Oh, that's so cheap."

1090
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,580
I was like, "Yeah."

1091
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:47,580
Yeah.

1092
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,580
It took exactly how long it would take to just walk.

1093
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:49,580
Yeah.

1094
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,580
A very short walk.

1095
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,580
Yeah.

1096
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,580
Yeah.

1097
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,580
Yeah.

1098
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,580
And the guy robbed me.

1099
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,580
Really?

1100
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,980
He took every last possession I had.

1101
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,980
Wow.

1102
00:56:58,980 --> 00:56:59,980
Yeah.

1103
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:00,980
And then he came upstairs.

1104
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,980
Came up here?

1105
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:02,980
And he made me open the door so he could watch TV.

1106
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,020
That makes sense because we've been sitting on the floor this whole time.

1107
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,900
Yeah, so he stole every single thing in my apartment.

1108
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:09,900
That makes so much sense.

1109
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:10,900
Remember there used to be a wall here?

1110
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:15,180
Yeah, I thought, I thought, you know, your, I thought your wife was doing another one of

1111
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,180
those projects.

1112
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,380
So basically he walked into my house, and then he went into Sims Bird's Eye View, and

1113
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:23,580
he just sold everything, including all the walls.

1114
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:26,220
So now I'm just in an empty apartment with no walls.

1115
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,220
But he kept the toilet though.

1116
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:28,220
Well he thought that was fucking funny.

1117
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,700
Yeah, he kept the toilet but he also installed.

1118
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,700
He thought it was funny, he was like, yeah, a guy who only owns a toilet, yeah that's

1119
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,700
fucking funny.

1120
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,460
I'm also, I mean I'm going into my UI right now, I am seeing that that toilet is, it's

1121
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:41,820
It's not worth any money at all because of what you've done to it over the years.

1122
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,020
Yeah, I've disgusted it.

1123
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,380
Is that illegal to do disgustings in your own toilet?

1124
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,700
No, but it depreciates the value so it makes sense that he wouldn't steal it.

1125
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,700
I think that it should appreciate the value.

1126
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,760
I'm just taking a logical standpoint to the situation.

1127
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,020
I just think it's weird that he downloaded the Hollywood pack and put six cameras around

1128
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,020
the toilet.

1129
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,340
That was a bit weird of him.

1130
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,460
Yeah, to buy the DLC just to do that.

1131
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:12,940
the DLC and it's like it's not even like like it's like 360 view all all cam

1132
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,940
quarters not even not the expensive ones to know because he doesn't want you to

1133
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:21,580
resell them it's all 360 view of just like the toilet well that's okay cuz

1134
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:25,740
then I can tape my shits like I'm doing stand-up so I can improve every single

1135
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,140
time yeah and then I'll send them to venues yes and yeah I just wanted to

1136
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,460
borrow bad bars and be like could you think I could do you think I can share

1137
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:36,020
What do you think of this?

1138
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:37,020
Here's a tape.

1139
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,020
I'll have my manager be in touch.

1140
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:40,980
I'd love to get five minutes in your bathroom tonight.

1141
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,540
Oh no, sorry.

1142
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,460
Listen, I watched your tape.

1143
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,540
Pretty good for a beginner, but we have some heavy hitters at this bathroom who will do

1144
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:52,700
30 minutes to an hour in our bathroom.

1145
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,940
So we like to set a standard.

1146
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,780
Maybe you work the door a couple nights.

1147
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,500
Maybe you open the bathroom door for some people.

1148
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:02,740
Maybe you're on wipe duty.

1149
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,740
nights you know you gotta earn your keep here. I mean look at some of these posters on the

1150
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:11,740
wall here we got Dom DeLuise you know that guy was taking insane shits. Mega shitter.

1151
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:18,740
Lizzo now that's a dookie. She's playing the flute. She put some dookies in that toilet.

1152
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:26,300
Yeah. Yeah. Shallow Hal. Shallow Hal is here. The character. He was here he signed it. He

1153
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:31,900
signed his thing cause he shit in our bathroom. We don't sell any food or drinks we are just

1154
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:38,140
a bathroom restaurant. I have had that idea before just in the city just like

1155
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:42,420
they should make a store that you can go to. You pay like that's actually

1156
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,780
actually, oh that's such a good idea, like a really nice bathroom. Yeah. Like in

1157
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:51,060
St. like like bidet. Uh-huh. Well actually there's different packages you can

1158
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:55,180
purchase. Yeah. One dollar you basically get a porta potty. Ten dollars. It's just like a

1159
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:00,880
tap on the door. Like it's not like a. Also you can pay to just be in there as

1160
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,360
long as you want. Yeah, it doesn't matter what you do in there. It's like the massage chairs

1161
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:09,300
at the mall and it's on a boat in the water so it's international water so you can do

1162
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,400
anything that you want in there. You can go in there, into that bathroom, as soon as that

1163
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,680
door is locked. You can sit on the toilet reverse. I don't care what you do. You can

1164
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:20,800
sit on it like a teacher having a heart to heart, right? But you're on the wall. Did

1165
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:28,000
you ever do that as a kid? Poop, do a reverse shit? Yeah. No. Do that in reverse so you

1166
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,760
to eat a hungry man dinner off the top of the toilet bowl.

1167
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:37,760
The toilet bowl?

1168
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,760
In the tank?

1169
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,760
What were you doing?

1170
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,240
Were you sitting on the floor and eating it off the bowl?

1171
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,240
Eat a hungry man off the top of the toilet tank?

1172
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,720
It's actually not a bad idea.

1173
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,720
Well that makes sense.

1174
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:50,720
Why is that tank there?

1175
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:53,000
That's farm to table.

1176
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That's just, you know.

1177
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,320
Maybe we've been fucking using toilets all wrong.

1178
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,600
the guy who invented the toilet invented it and he was like this is great people

1179
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,680
sit and they'll have a little place to work while they shit and then he immediately died and

1180
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:10,480
then someone could tell no one knew and then backwards Dan walked in and sat on

1181
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,580
the toilet and everyone was like oh that guy looks like he knows what he's

1182
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:18,120
doing yeah well I know it's backwards Dan he does everything backwards yeah he

1183
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:24,640
walked up to the toilet backwards. Backwards Dan. You can shit fast, fast as you can.

1184
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,640
It's like he walked up there backwards, he was speaking in reverse.

1185
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,640
Nobody could tell he was backwards, Dan.

1186
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,640
They thought he was a genius German scientist.

1187
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,640
They thought he was a normal guy named Nad.

1188
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Yeah.

1189
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,640
Yeah.

1190
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
Alright.

1191
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:40,640
Is that it?

1192
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,640
We're done.

1193
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,640
That's it? Alright, well, uh...

1194
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,640
I mean, unless you guys want to say something else.

1195
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:46,640
Uh, I'm barely...

1196
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
Boogers.

1197
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,640
I've been eating boogers. Fucking a booger.

1198
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:52,640
Eating too many boogers.
