00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,120
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,880

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:14,960
♪ I still see your armor in my room ♪

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,800
That's what it is.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,960
♪ Can't get back the emeralds I gave you ♪

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,080
Wait, I'm gonna play that one that I just sent you guys.

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,000
Wait, can I play that one into the mic?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,840
Is that okay?

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Do we do gifts up top?

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,160
No, we're doing theme song.

12
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,000
Shut up!

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,200
We're doing our new theme song that we found.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,480
Yeah, just chill for a second.

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
I mean to tell you to shut up.

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
This is Lucid Dreams Minecraft parody by Fleep.

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,640
77 views.

18
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,200
3 years ago.

19
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
This is going to blow your mind.

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,360
This is real shit.

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,880
Rap along if you know the words.

22
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,440
This kid also overdosed on Percocet.

23
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,880
He did.

24
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,360
It's just because he took one.

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,360
He was too small.

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,360
He's too young.

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Here we go.

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
Here we go.

29
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Get ready.

30
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
He took one, 60-ish.

31
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
He took a Perc5.

32
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Your creepers in my room can't take back the diamonds I give you.

33
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,360
It says that I am enchanted, but I break it and I cannot build it.

34
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,360
So I must replace it all.

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Easier said than mine, that you were my diamond.

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,360
The same two black blocks and emeralds instead of my head.

37
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,360
You've got another diamond, but my blocks are enchanted.

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,360
I am the better Minecraft crafter and won't let you loot me.

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,360
This is so serious though.

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
Yeah, damn.

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
Straight up.

42
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
He's putting his whole heart into this.

43
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
Absolutely.

44
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Yeah.

45
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
You do me a huge favor.

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
What?

47
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
I forgot to do this when I got here.

48
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Can you?

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Shit, hold up.

50
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Is he taking out my gift?

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
No.

52
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
What are you doing?

53
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
You wish I was taking it out.

54
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
What did I forget?

55
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
You wish.

56
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
What did you forget?

57
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
I forgot to...

58
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
You want me to plug your headphones in?

59
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Yeah.

60
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm gonna plug the diamond, listen to my blocks in my head

61
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

62
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

64
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

65
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

66
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

68
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,360
You find a doll, and I'm gonna rock you like a rock star

69
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,660
Yeah, yeah, the chords you have a chord like you're not like tied to your chair. Yeah, I know I forgot to do a

This song in a Minecraft. Yeah

00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,660
You know like that yeah

74
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,540
You're a flamer. Yeah, you're a gamer damn. I've heard that one in a long time

75
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah, you're about to hear it for me for the next couple weeks. You just reminded me

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,040
Yeah, yeah, hell yeah. We're playing right back cuz you even get in trouble for saying flamer. I feel like now I feel like

77
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
Probably I mean

78
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,500
Going to like a gay bar like standing at the door John flamer

79
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,320
Like as soon as everyone I think they wouldn't get mad like I've got no

80
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,360
No, no gay guy would get mad if you called them a flamer

81
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,680
Let's test it out. Okay. Let's go to the hood. I call people

82
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,080
Calling people Flamer in the hood.

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Viral video.

84
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
God awesome.

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,720
It's just a bunch of guys saying thank you.

86
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Thank you very much.

87
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I am a Flamer.

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
I appreciate it.

89
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
What are you doing?

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
What?

91
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Siri is talking to you.

92
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,720
God damn.

93
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I leaned out of my way.

94
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,720
No, come on, pull it up.

95
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,720
No, come on, let's talk to Siri.

96
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Let's talk to Siri.

97
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,720
Okay.

98
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Hey Siri, call Caleb.

99
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Calling Red Caleb home.

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,080
Hey Siri, call Caleb.

101
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,720
Calling Red Caleb home.

102
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,240
I'm getting a phone call.

103
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Who could that be?

104
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Why are you whispering?

105
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Hello?

106
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Hey.

107
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:57,360
Can you put yours on speaker so I can hear you?

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,400
It's going to do an infinite loop and everybody's going to get mad.

109
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Damn it.

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
It's going to sound awful.

111
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I'm not going to do an infinite loop.

112
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm not going to do an infinite loop with you.

113
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Why not?

114
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Because it's going to, I hate that sound.

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
I would love to be stuck with you in an infinite loop.

116
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You would hate that.

117
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,080
If you and me got stuck in a Palm Springs situation, you'd hate that.

118
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,120
We're going to go to Palm Springs?

119
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,120
You haven't seen that movie?

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,920
I'd like to go to Palm Springs with you.

121
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,360
Great, now an alarm is going off.

122
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,480
What the hell is happening in this house today?

123
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
This is a rough start.

124
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
You made me plug in headphones.

125
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,480
You know what?

126
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
I can redeem this.

127
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,480
How?

128
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
How ever will you redeem it?

129
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Close your eyes.

130
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,360
I've got to turn this fucking alarm off.

131
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
the gift alarm.

132
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,860
Ok, well he's over there Cameron, close your eyes.

133
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,860
No, wait until he gets back.

134
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,860
I want to see him get my gift.

135
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
I want him to see me get my gift.

136
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:46,320
Ok, I'll put his on his chair so then he comes back and he sees it.

137
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,360
No, just wait.

138
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Just wait.

139
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
We'll have a conversation just the two of us.

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Alright.

141
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,080
I saw this when I was shopping for a humidifier recently.

142
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,580
I saw this review that I remembered last night and I couldn't fall asleep because I kept

143
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,580
laughing out loud.

144
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,520
I was trying to fall asleep about it where somebody was like, "I bought this for my son's

145
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,140
bedroom and when we plugged it in it emitted the most foul odor I've ever

146
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,220
smelled in my life. So we threw it away but we couldn't get rid of

147
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,700
the smell and now my son won't sleep in his bedroom anymore. And I was lying there

148
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,300
trying to fall asleep but I just kept going like...

149
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:23,260
There's a thing about the evil humidifier. It ruined a whole room.

150
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,980
When my youngest brother was like young and he's like a lot younger than me

151
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,980
He had a room and we had a dog, a really young dog.

152
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,260
Brody was really young at the time.

153
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,860
And his room smelled terrible for like a month and a half.

154
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,420
It smelled like complete shit.

155
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,540
And my little brother was maybe like three or four.

156
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,860
And we were like, "What the fuck is this smell?

157
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,340
It smells terrible."

158
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,340
And then one day, he like, came up, he like, called me into his room, and he's like, "Hey

159
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,580
Caleb, look what I just found under my truck."

160
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,540
And it was just like a humongous pile of dog shit that had been sitting there for like

161
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,540
six weeks.

162
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,140
And he was just sleeping in a shit room.

163
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Dude!

164
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
And that's why he's like that.

165
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,140
The miasma would fuckin'-

166
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,140
That's absolutely why he's like that now.

167
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,140
Yeah.

168
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,220
No, you guys never went to my parents' old place.

169
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,920
If it was under a toy truck, he should have been moving that truck around and

170
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
playing with it.

171
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Yeah, he should have been playing with the truck.

172
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,260
There was already something wrong with him if he wasn't playing with the truck.

173
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Yeah, you're right.

174
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260
He should have been with the trucks.

175
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
No, you guys never went to the place in Manchester.

176
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
If it was under a Barbie, he would have found it.

177
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
You know what I'm saying?

178
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
Yeah.

179
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
Oh, shit.

180
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
Got his ass.

181
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Yeah.

182
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
I hope he's listening.

183
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:43,300
I lived in that really old, that fucking, like my sister's house, my sister and my parents,

184
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,540
where they lived in that place in Ware.

185
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
And uh...

186
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
Ware?

187
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:54,580
where where where where in New Hampshire where in New Hampshire this yeah no where

188
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:01,060
in New Hampshire where wait no you lived in nowhere where underwear

189
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,660
god damn let's go we planned that before how did you guys know I was gonna walk

190
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,420
into that I mean under where I'm fuck wait wait what I'm gonna wear in her

191
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:20,420
wear? I barely... They caught me in her wear. I was wearing ladies clothes.

192
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,780
Ladies clothes? Mm-hmm. I do feel like I... Oh, but there was a mouse that died.

193
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,820
A mouse died in the ceiling and the smell, it was in my room. Yeah.

194
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,900
And the smell in there, we didn't know what it was for weeks until, and that's

195
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,740
how I learned what a dead mouse smells like. What does it smell like? It's like,

196
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:50,500
like a decaying flesh. I'd like to see Patrick do like an 8th grade spelling bee. I would

197
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:58,980
kill it dude. Unless the words were room or warrior. And then you do R-U-M and W-O-Y-E-R.

198
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:06,260
Dude I got room. Room is fine dude. That's normal. Rum? Rum? I don't say rum. You do.

199
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,380
No I don't. You say rum. Yeah we both say rum. Rum. And then you say warrior. Warrior I don't

200
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,780
know. I'm dropping an R in there. That one's weird. I don't know about that one. There's

201
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:23,780
two R's and you're replacing them with a Y. Warrior. But I'll defend rum. That's an okay

202
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,220
thing to say. I don't know where warrior came from. Rum is a proud New England tradition.

203
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,980
Warrior. Rum? My grandmother, she would say roof. I don't say roof though. Yeah I don't

204
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
either. I say roof. I sometimes say roof.

205
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:40,300
Yeah, because your grandma, you know why? Because she was a dog. Nope. Dog asshole bitch. No.

206
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:46,220
Yep. No. Dog. Wrong. Yeah. Wrong. Frog. Fum. Did you guys know that rabies has like a 100%

207
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,220
kill rate? Isn't that cool? What? In people? Yeah. Isn't it crazy how like if you get rabies

208
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,220
you're like afraid of water? And you just die, you 100% die. But like, like, it's not

209
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,500
like, like, is it like if you see water you run away or can it be like if somebody tells

210
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,260
you about water you get scared too. I think if you're to the point where you're afraid

211
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,540
of water. Imagine a glass of water and you start you get really scared. I don't think

212
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,820
it makes I don't think you would like I don't think you can understand English if you're

213
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,740
to the point in rabies where you're afraid of water. I think I would I would. I think

214
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,140
you. If I get the shot. If you saw a picture of water would you be afraid of it? Maybe.

215
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:26,740
Yeah that's possible. I could probably survive rabies. Well apparently there's been six people

216
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,500
who have ever survived rabies.

217
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,340
- What? - There's only seven.

218
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,580
- Yeah. - When I'm there.

219
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,060
- Six people ever. - I'm through with rabies.

220
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,300
- Damn. - Isn't that cool?

221
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,980
- That can't be true. - It's true, look it up.

222
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,020
Six people ever and they were all just like,

223
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,420
they think that they have just some like genetic,

224
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,100
like predisposition to like-- - They're half dog.

225
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,940
- Yeah. - I do.

226
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,740
- They had some kind of doggy DNA in them.

227
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,220
- I-- - You think you have dog DNA?

228
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,460
- I think I have-- - You do have dog DNA.

229
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,140
Oh my God, you have dog DNA.

230
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,500
You have dog. - I sleep on the floor.

231
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,620
- Yeah, you do have dog DNA. - I eat a lot of beef jerky.

232
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,500
You have that extra toe like halfway up your leg.

233
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,500
Yeah.

235
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,360
Damn.

236
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,980
That makes so much sense.

237
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,480
And a tail.

238
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,980
Your tail, yeah.

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,480
Yeah.

240
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:05,980
That doesn't explain your tail.

241
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,480
I mean the tail is...

242
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,980
Yeah.

243
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,160
You like everybody.

244
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,400
Mm-hmm.

245
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,980
You mostly have your tongue out.

246
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,480
Yeah.

247
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
I don't have my tongue out a lot.

248
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
I think I'm one of the... I'm not like a pug.

249
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
You would definitely be one of these fucked up, smushy...

250
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Nah, I'd be like a golden doodle.

251
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,980
You'd be like what?

252
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
I'd be like a golden doodle.

253
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,740
No, you'd be a shit, dirt, cheap, fucking dog.

254
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,740
Yeah, what the hell?

256
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
That's so mean.

257
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,940
I don't know.

258
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,820
I don't think you'd be a golden doodle.

259
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
Yes I would.

260
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
No, you wouldn't.

261
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Nothing about you strikes me as golden, personally.

262
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
Yeah, that's one of the golden doodles.

263
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Golden retriever poodle mix.

264
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:46,140
You might be like a pink doodle.

265
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,140
A chocolate doodle?

266
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,780
No, just like a pink, rosy cheeks.

267
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,460
I think I'm a chocolate doodle.

268
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:52,300
I don't think you're a doodle.

269
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,180
I think I might be a doodle.

270
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,540
You do not have, no part of you is doodly.

271
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,980
You're not hypoallergenic.

272
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
- No, I am.

273
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,640
- No.

274
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,480
- No, I have a lot of allergies.

275
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,460
- You are full of dander.

276
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,300
- No.

277
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,120
- Yeah.

278
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,500
You're completely, and you have brain worms.

279
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,580
- No, I got heart worms.

280
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,740
- No, heart worms.

281
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,780
- That's my problem.

282
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,620
- Yeah.

283
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,060
- I do take a lot of heart worm medication just to be safe.

284
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,900
- Smart.

285
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,720
- Yeah.

286
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,560
- What is that, Zantac?

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,860
No, Zantac's for heartburn.

288
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,940
I take a lot of heartburn medication too.

289
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,020
- You think you have heartburn 'cause it's warm.

290
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,500
My heart burns for worms.

291
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,580
How do you, how does a dog get heart worms?

292
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
They just get it in there.

293
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
They just get it in food.

294
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
Yeah.

295
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580
Who, does their food go to their heart?

296
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,620
And they eat, dogs eat anything off the ground.

297
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,420
Which, another thing I do.

298
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Yeah.

299
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,300
It does, it's starting to make more and more sense.

300
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,260
Yeah, when I was at a...

301
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,300
I almost picked up a Twix off the ground the other day.

302
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,620
I was really drunk one time and ate a slice of pizza off the floor.

303
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,020
One time I was in the Dallas airport.

304
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
At Suffolk University.

305
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,540
And there was a half empty bag of trail mix on the ground I ate it.

306
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
Yeah.

307
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,180
in the wrapper on the ground?

308
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,820
- You see I saw Twix on the ground the other day

309
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,420
in the wrapper, it's completely sealed.

310
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,500
- Yeah, if it's completely sealed--

311
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,060
- I was with Joe though.

312
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:01,900
- I'll pick it up.

313
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,060
- And I wasn't gonna, if it was--

314
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:04,900
- I'll do that in front of Joe, I don't give a shit.

315
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,740
- If there was nobody with me I would've eaten it.

316
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,700
But I was like, I'm not gonna eat,

317
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,540
I'm not gonna just like,

318
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,780
it was in the middle of,

319
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,420
I was in a conversation with him.

320
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,620
And I'm not gonna, in the middle--

321
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,180
- Yeah, I would've straight up stopped him.

322
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,660
- In the middle of talking to him,

323
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,860
I'm not gonna bend over and eat a,

324
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,060
something from the floor.

325
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,620
it is i don't like it don't know if you're outside or outside you know where

326
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,040
like what what what where where was arrested

327
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,640
is that it was on the sidewalk on the sidewalk to the group thrown candy from

328
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,240
the floats in the privacy at the thing to be different or if it was in grass

329
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,960
in grass i feel it's almost

330
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,020
in grass above could get in it

331
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,800
affiliates of those who are on the side will not be done

332
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,100
you are definitely not in new york

333
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,120
in i kinda was like there's got to have so later i was like

334
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,920
as they met with slater cuz i'd

335
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,060
can you tell me a look at what if you saw it works

336
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,660
on top of a closed trash can

337
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,680
it's not so i don't know

338
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
on top of the video covered in cheese

339
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
i'd probably i would probably more inclined to eat

340
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,820
a twigs on a trash can

341
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,800
then it would so is in spaghetti i'm trying to find your like your line

342
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,880
and letting that weeks in the toilet

343
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,680
if that's a fully sealed police you get no water than that

344
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,200
is there

345
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,520
a turd in the toilet. No, it's just the Twix. Oh yeah, I'll eat that. But there's pee on

346
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,360
the rim of the bowl. So you don't know if somebody went in there and just was really

347
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,700
hydrated. But is there somebody who pees out, he like passed it like a kidney stone? Did

348
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,800
somebody push this? Would you eat a Twix that came from a man's penis? Okay, yeah. If it's

349
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,480
wrapped. Okay, what if the Twix is in the toilet and you know 100% that someone did

350
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,040
pee on it, but it's sealed in the wrapper? Then it doesn't matter. It's floating in pee

351
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,400
in the toilet you have to reach into the pee to get the Twix.

352
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,960
No candy is worth it for me to touch pee.

353
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,280
What if it's a really big Twix?

354
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,880
But if somebody, hmm, if somebody gets...

355
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,880
If you had a glove and the Twix was floating in pee.

356
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

357
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Oh, absolutely.

358
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,880
Are you kidding me?

359
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,080
Would you take it out and you wash it in the sink?

360
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
You'd wash it in the sink, okay.

361
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Yeah.

362
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,720
I'd probably put soap on it.

363
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Hold on.

364
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
What if it was a Baby Ruth instead?

365
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Baby Ruth is better than a Twix.

366
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
What about an Almond Joy?

367
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Okay, what about an Almond Joy?

368
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Do you like Almond Joy?

369
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,540
eat one out of the wrapper stuck in a piece of shit. What's it what can do you

370
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,940
not like? Mounds. I like I kind of... Can you think of a candy that's like a map?

371
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,620
That'd be funny if you were like really into a mid candy. A mid candy? Maybe a payday.

372
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:33,380
One that you don't love. I love everything. You know what I've been thinking about it I love payday too.

373
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,300
I have a bag I've been eating candy every day since Christmas. Yeah. I've been eating like 10 pieces of candy.

374
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,020
What about a circus peanut? Oh I like. I like circus peanuts. I haven't had a circus peanut.

375
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,180
You never had a circus peanut?

376
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,180
No.

377
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,580
Is that like a Boston baked bean thing?

378
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
No.

379
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,420
Oh, Boston baked beans, Jesus Christ, I gotta get some of those.

380
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
What about you, like candy corn?

381
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
Are you a candy corn fan?

382
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
Love candy corn.

383
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,420
I love candy corn too.

384
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Would you eat candy corn out of the toilet?

385
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,820
If there was no water in the toilet, and the candy corn, and the candy corn, would you

386
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,380
scoop the candy corn that's not touching the edge of the toilet, off out of the middle,

387
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,380
and eat that?

388
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,100
Wait, describe this better.

389
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,580
It's a toilet, and it's complete, the bowl has no, nothing in it.

390
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,380
- When you flush more candy corn comes out.

391
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,180
- No, listen, the bowl is completely filled with candy corn.

392
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,020
- I'm listening.

393
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,840
- So there's a lot of candy corn

394
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,680
that's touching the bowl, right?

395
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,520
- Oh, yeah.

396
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,340
- But in the middle there's candy corn that's not.

397
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,180
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,340
- You would eat the one in the middle.

399
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,660
- Yeah, I'd probably eat every--

400
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,160
- How much, how far would you go?

401
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,980
How many layers of candy corn away from the bowl

402
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,820
would you eat to?

403
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,500
- Okay, so I would get a Ziploc gallon bag

404
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,620
and I would fill it up as much as I--

405
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,240
- Oh, you'd pick it up like dog shit?

406
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,080
- Yeah.

407
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,820
- Like you'd invert the bag and then grab it out?

408
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,900
And I'd pick up like probably, I'd probably go two, I'd probably, here I'll show you.

409
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Here's what.

410
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,220
I'd probably put it like it was one big glove and then I would, I would kind of scoop around

411
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,180
it like this, create like a little ball and then I would pull it up like this and then

412
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,180
I would zip it.

413
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,180
Okay.

414
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

415
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,940
And you would do that without a second thought.

416
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
You do that immediately.

417
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,860
If you walked into the bathroom and you saw candy corn, you just, you do that.

418
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
It's candy.

419
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
It's candy.

420
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,740
But even if you needed to go to the bathroom.

421
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,940
Well of course I have to get rid of the candy corn before I go to the bathroom.

422
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,940
Would you?

423
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,940
And then I have something to eat while I sit down.

424
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,140
Okay, would you, if you had to go to the bathroom really bad.

425
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
Okay, okay, wait, no, okay, here's a new scenario.

426
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,740
She eats brownie from a hungry pan on the toilet.

427
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
Yes.

428
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,860
I'm also very pro eating and drinking on while you do that shit.

429
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,420
Did I ever tell you, did I ever tell you to sit down on the toilet a lot of times?

430
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,540
Here's a new scenario.

431
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,380
You have to go to the bathroom so bad.

432
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,900
You have to pee so, so bad.

433
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,100
Okay, and you're not very hungry.

434
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
You're pretty full.

435
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,740
Well, but I'm not, but I'm, I'm food full, right?

436
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
I'm not candy full.

437
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
Okay, you're pretty candy full.

438
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,900
You walk in, okay, no, listen to my scenario, Patrick.

439
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,340
You are trying to ruin this anti-scenario.

440
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,340
I'm adding to it.

441
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
No, you're not.

442
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,420
You are taking away from it.

443
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:53,580
Now listen, you walk into the bathroom, you're about, your bladder is about to explode.

444
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,060
Droplets are shooting out of your pee hole like particles of light.

445
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,580
That's how fast they're going.

446
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,980
You open up the toilet lid and you're about to pee.

447
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,860
It's completely filled with candy corn.

448
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,860
There's no water.

449
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,580
You have a Ziploc bag in your pocket.

450
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:13,100
Are you scooping out candy corn to eat first or are you just going to pee right into it?

451
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,100
Which is more important to you?

452
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,580
Honestly, I would rather piss...

453
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,260
And you just took the pill that makes you hungry.

454
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,140
I would rather piss my pants...

455
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
Even if you're candy full.

456
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,780
...than waste that much candy.

457
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,780
Even if you're candy full.

458
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,780
Because, okay, so I can't...

459
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,180
So it's a whole toilet full of candy corn?

460
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Yeah.

461
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:34,180
lifetime supply of candy corn at your apartment? A lifetime supply? Well yeah, but it's in my toilet.

462
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,340
And it's that, it's that. No, this is a different, you're at a restaurant. Oh. And it's that like

463
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,780
brown candy corn too. Okay, well let me ask you. You know the candy corn that has the brown on the

464
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:46,820
bottom? Yeah. Do I have? And you don't know if it's the candy corn with the brown on the bottom

465
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,140
or the normal candy corn that's just been in the toilet. Answer me this. It got brown from the

466
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Exactly. That's what I'm saying you don't know.

467
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,140
Answer me this Riddle Master.

468
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:03,140
If I'm at a restaurant and I have a lifetime supply at home, do I have any candy corn with me?

469
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
Yeah, is candy corn on the menu at the restaurant?

470
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
Yes, it is.

471
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Okay, did I order the candy corn?

472
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Yes.

473
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,140
Well, then it makes you think.

474
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,140
But you finished it already.

475
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,140
Then probably...

476
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,140
You have no more left.

477
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,140
Then probably not because it's possible that somebody else at the restaurant ordered the candy corn and candy corn doesn't digest.

478
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
It shits it all out.

479
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,140
Okay, you made the right choice, because can I tell you the secret detail?

480
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,140
What's the secret detail?

481
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Before you walked into the bathroom, a really, really fat guy walked out.

482
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,140
[Laughter]

483
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,140
Huh.

484
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,140
Wait, or maybe a really skinny guy who was really fat when he walked in.

485
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,140
Yeah.

486
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,140
I was like, it's like the ghost in the sauna in Halloween Town.

487
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,140
Yeah. Okay. Alright.

488
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,140
Yeah, so I would not eat that candy, I don't think.

489
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,140
He ordered a lot of candy corn at the restaurant.

490
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
I swear.

491
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Yeah. Yeah, I bet you would.

492
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,140
I bet you would.

493
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,740
But I'm so pro candy.

494
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,540
I've been running, you know when you get a bag of candy for Christmas or something?

495
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,540
Here I'll show you guys.

496
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Oh hell.

497
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,780
Dude, I'm getting some candy shipped to me from my dad's house.

498
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,780
Whoa.

499
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,780
You're getting candy chips?

500
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,780
I'm getting a candy shipment.

501
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,260
You know they had, they used to make.

502
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,820
This is my candy bag.

503
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Damn.

504
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,660
Oh dude, oh holy shit.

505
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
It's gotten really bad.

506
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,220
Can I give you a dollar for that marshmallow reindeer?

507
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,260
You want the reindeer, not the Santa?

508
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,260
You like the strawberry?

509
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,900
Wait, is that the, it's the marshmallow one, right?

510
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
Yeah.

511
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,700
Shit, dude, actually I might take the strawberry one.

512
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,700
This is the strawberry one.

513
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,460
Actually, can I give you a quarter for it?

514
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
You can have both of them.

515
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Whoa.

516
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
For free.

517
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,460
Holy shit.

518
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,460
You know why?

519
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,460
Because this is the worst candy in the world.

520
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
I still like it.

521
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Those are terrible.

522
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
I don't care.

523
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
So do you eat those out of a toilet?

524
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Yes, of course.

525
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
Wait, okay, you said you like all candies.

526
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
This is the one that you don't?

527
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
I still love it.

528
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,460
I would, like, do anything for that.

529
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,460
But it's not my favorite.

530
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,660
So this is my point.

531
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
So this is...

532
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
Okay, I got you guys your presents.

533
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,660
So this is...

534
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
It's too...

535
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,300
So this used to be chock full of just every...

536
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Chock full.

537
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
Every...

538
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
A lot of chocolate, okay?

539
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
It had...

540
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Chock full.

541
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,620
It had a ton of Reese's trees, Christmas trees.

542
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Oh, those are good.

543
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
White and milk chocolate.

544
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,620
Those are good as fuck.

545
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,620
Right?

546
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,620
Oh, dude.

547
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,740
So now I'm down at the bottom, so I got some Mexican shit in here.

548
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,340
I got some fucking shit that...

549
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,940
Oh, dude, yeah, there's a Konos in there.

550
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,820
Yeah, dude, I got candy canes.

551
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,380
I got Lifesavers.

552
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,580
I got fucking a piece of peppermint bark, but I still eat probably four pieces of this per

553
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,580
day.

554
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,100
I've not slowed down at all because candy is candy.

555
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,100
Is that gum's lifesavers?

556
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,860
Or is that, um, gummy lifesavers or hard candy lifesavers?

557
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Hard candy.

558
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,500
I got a candy box coming in the mail and I can't wait.

559
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,940
I'm going to make my own candy bag.

560
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
I love candy.

561
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,780
And I forget every year from February to October.

562
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,620
I forget how much I love candy.

563
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
And then I get some candy for free.

564
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
It's important to forget that you like candy.

565
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,620
Because otherwise my candy budget is very low right now.

566
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,020
I'd be blowing it.

567
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:54,860
The realization, I had this, when I went back home last weekend, I had like the realization

568
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,860
like oh yeah, no, finding out that I could just buy candy and beer for dinner fucking

569
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,480
ruined me for a year.

570
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,820
You guys saw me, sometimes I'd eat just like a bag of like Sour Patch Kids and like a Modelo.

571
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
A Modelo?

572
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:19,380

580
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,220

biting into it is like really loud like it did like it's like every time you

582
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,580
bite into it it's just like it sounds like it sounds like when you're like

583
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,580
biting into a handful of popcorn.

584
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,580
Going to Alamo Draft House.

585
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
So everybody's watching the movie and it's just going like...

586
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,580
Ordering a 64 ounce

587
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,580
cup filled with

588
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,580
pop rocks at Alamo Draft House.

589
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,580
And you're eating the popcorn elote like

590
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,580
Looney Tunes, so you're like...

591
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,580
They just kick you out for anything there, right?

592
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,580
Yeah. Alamo Draft House.

593
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
I only went there one time. Did you get kicked out?

594
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,580
No. I feel like you got it.

595
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
They kicked me out at the end of the freaking movie.

596
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,620
I wasn't even done with the credits! I thought there was gonna be more credits!

597
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,940
Yeah, I wanted to see second credits.

598
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,260
Who made the credits? Where's the credits for the credits?

599
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,540
I thought there was a post-credits scene in Licorice Pizza.

600
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,380
There should have been one. Every movie should have a post-credits scene.

601
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,860
Yep, Bradley Cooper shows his penis. That's a post-credits scene.

602
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,660
It should be, no, it should be Iron Man should be in all of them.

603
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,180
Oh, so Iron Man shows Bradley Cooper's penis.

604
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,300
Iron Man should show up and recruit whoever's in the movie.

605
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,860
Yeah.

606
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:51,340
Right? So like at the end of, like, at the end of, uh, Hereditary.

607
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:51,840
Yeah.

608
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,920
Bradley Iron Man should show up and recruit the girl's head.

609
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:01,140
Yeah, it's just like a shot of Iron Man's glove picking up the head.

610
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,640
Yeah.

611
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,140
I think it should.

612
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,340
And he's like talking to the head.

613
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,840
He's like, "Do you want to join the Avengers?"

614
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,340
Yeah.

615
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:07,840
That's what he says.

616
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,340
Yeah, that could be good.

617
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,340
Because he died too.

618
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,840
Well, I think it should be, instead of Iron Man, I think it should be Thanos shows up and kills the main character.

619
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Or like one of the secondary characters.

620
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
And then the main character of the movie is like, "I'll get you one day, Thanos."

621
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
Mm-hmm.

622
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,080
Thanos and then it's like

623
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,400
Thanos one day I'll get you

624
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,400
It's like the Paw Patrol will return in Marvel's Marvel

625
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,080
We already did this

626
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,720
We did?

627
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,000
We are when when Caleb was away and we did karaoke we talked for like 20 minutes about

628
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,080
Oh every superhero getting cancer

629
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,760
About a giant Marvel crossover with every movie ever where they all have cancer

630
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,080
Yeah

631
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,480
So we

632
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,840
Well it'd be so sad though

633
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,640
Yeah well you'll have to go back and listen to it if you want to hear how actually funny and as hell it is

634
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,400
(laughing)

635
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
- Yeah, don't tell me that's funny.

636
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,240
- I won't spoil anything about it.

637
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,840
But it's pretty weird.

638
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,000
- Okay, so candy has gotten me in a serious present move.

639
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,040
- Yep. - Move.

640
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,880
- All right. - Mood.

641
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,720
- All right.

642
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,540
- Mood. - Yours is already out.

643
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,960
- My move is so happily today.

644
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,040
- So Cameron, close your eyes.

645
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,200

and then I give, no wait.

647
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,860
- Oh, that is for me.

648
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,840
- Yeah, this is Caleb's gift.

649
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,040
- Am I holding on my hand right?

650
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,760
- So I'm not, so Cameron,

651
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,960

He has a beautiful frail body.

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,160
It's going to look sick as hell at the casino.

690
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Holy dude.

691
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
This is going to be so...

692
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Now I just need pants.

693
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
- Yeah.

694
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,840
- You mean, if anyone has a--

695
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,000
- Oh shit, I forgot about the pants.

696
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,120
- If anyone has a lead on Chinese pants.

697
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,560
- Yeah, do they make those?

698
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,400
Do those exist?

699
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,920
- I don't think they wear pants.

700
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,040
- You gotta get some kind of green satin pants.

701
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,540
- I also need to get Chinese shoes that aren't slippers

702
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,380
so I can wear them.

703
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,560
- True, yeah.

704
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,640
You said that you got me two gifts.

705
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,240
- No, I kept one of them.

706
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
- What was the other one?

707
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,360
- It was a XXL Freshman 2017 Snapback

708
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
sponsored by Magnum Condoms.

709
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,200
- And you gave me this shit?

710
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,600
And you kept that one for yourself?

711
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,440
- Yes.

712
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:45,440
I

713
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
I know you're fucking...

714
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,880
I told you.

715
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
I just downloaded...

716
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,480
I told you I knocked it out of the park first try.

717
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
This is good.

718
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
This is really good.

719
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
I just downloaded Duolingo today.

720
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,680
So, probably going to try and learn Chinese soon.

721
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Damn.

722
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,200
The Chinese century is happening.

723
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
I'm really excited to be Chinese.

724
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,120
It's going to be a tough road ahead of you.

725
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
It's going to be hard.

726
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Yeah.

727
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,840
But I'm going to persevere through my struggle.

728
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,680
A lot of people aren't going to like a lot of the things I do in my path to become Chinese.

729
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
You're going to hit a wall.

730
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
A great wall.

731
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:18,720
of all you're gonna have to push past that yes to finally be like an invader

732
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,680
like a Mongolian and like a Mongol horde member fine I'll become Mongolian no you

733
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,800
guys can spar well then we'll have to spar but sparring is a friendly thing

734
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,880
yeah that's true that's true you'll probably you'll end up pillaging me and

735
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,040
doing other things that come with pillaging - I wouldn't I don't even I

736
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,480
wouldn't want to pillage you I respect you too much to ever pillage that's

737
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,480
really nice of you to say. And then Pat can be Marco Polo.

738
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,080
Marco. Marco. Marco Polo. Don't you say just say Polo.

739
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,080
No, you'd be the guy. Marco. Marco Polo.

740
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:03,440
Yeah, you'll be Marco Polo. You guys don't know how to play this at all.

741
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,440
I'll go over there and I'll say it. He invented seeing fireworks for the first

742
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,840
time. Really? Wow.

743
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,680
In that game... Is that what he does? I literally, I only know the game.

744
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,200
He went to... In the game, if it was realistic, in the game, when you catch somebody, you

745
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,480
would rape them. That's what he was. Is that what he did? Yeah, he was a bad guy. He was

746
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,280
a bad guy? No, he wrote about how beautiful China was. No. No, no, no. I thought he just

747
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,040
liked swimming. Nope. He was a... I thought he was just like a really good swimmer. He

748
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:35,040
was a super duper raper. Yeah. Can't have shit nowadays, huh? Serious Michael Jordan.

749
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
Michael Jordan.

750
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
Of, oh yeah.

751
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,280
Like he had crazy, well more like Wilt Chamberlain I guess.

752
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,560
He had some crazy numbers.

753
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
Yeah.

754
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
He was putting them.

755
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
That's rough.

756
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Yeah.

757
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
Wow.

758
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
I actually don't know if that's true.

759
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Yeah, I don't know if that's true either.

760
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Marco Polo was kind of just a guy like.

761
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
He went to China and he wrote about like.

762
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Well, who was that guy?

763
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,560
The one they just fucking canceled the holiday.

764
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,560
Patrick Dorn.

765
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Bill Gates.

766
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,560
No.

767
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Bill Gates?

768
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
No.

769
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Bill Gates?

770
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
No, what?

771
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:12,540
What did you Franklin did like to get his you like to get his fanny tickled? Yeah?

772
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,960
Nah, you got a

773
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,120
His fanny tickled by a fancy French woman. Yeah. Yeah, the French woman would take a big feather giant feather

774
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:29,040
Set a feather big too big to belong to any real bird and white - no white bird is that it's like a die

775
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
It's like they bleached a peacock feather

776
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,440
Yeah, it's like they bleached the the long feather that runs down the spine of a condor

777
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,760
Yeah, and they put it they would just they would go up and down that thing make it brown

778
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,520
Mm-hmm, you know, they didn't have to early paperbacks. Yeah, they turned and I mean the feather it would get so wet

779
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,840
It would turn to a line. Yeah, I got all that all that. Yeah

780
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,880
We got you know

781
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,280
Tough to party would just get and then they would like a like that and call it macaroni like the tail of a cat

782
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,280
It would look like yeah. Yeah, it looked really bad. Yeah. Yeah, and that's where they go the other direction

783
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,280
It'll look like a pine cone.

784
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,280
And then one day he...

785
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
That's why the song is called Yankee Doodle.

786
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
One day he pulled the thing...

787
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,560
Because it's got a lot of doodle on it.

788
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,960
He pulled it out of his ass and he got struck by lightning.

789
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Yeah.

790
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,960
Yeah.

791
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,960
Yeah.

792
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,600
Well, he only pulled it out of his ass because he had his keys on it.

793
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Yeah.

794
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,040
Well, he couldn't find them.

795
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Yeah.

796
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,040
Well, his keys were in his ass in the feather.

797
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Yeah.

798
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,760
There was a feather and keys in his ass.

799
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,600
But he was looking for his Game Boy, which was also in there.

800
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
And a kite.

801
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
A kite was in there too.

802
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Yeah.

803
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Did he...

804
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,840
What is the importance of that story?

805
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,840
I never understood.

806
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:38,040
electricity he didn't event did he did event he didn't event electricity

807
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:45,120
discovered that if you fly a kite with a key it will be crazy it will be crazy

808
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,400
what happens when I do this hypothesis even did the scientific method yeah

809
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,320
silliest glasses in the world it will look crazy when I wear these I think

810
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,280
I think he was more of a novelty inventor.

811
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Yeah.

812
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,280
He literally was.

813
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,280
He invented chattering teeth.

814
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,720
A lot of people know that.

815
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,720
He invented the Groucho Marshmallow.

816
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,220
I mean, literally down the side of that is the chattering teeth and the original teeth

817
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,760
were slave teeth.

818
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,160
He did invent a fake poop too.

819
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,000
He did almanacs too.

820
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,720
Which is like, he's just like Peggy Hill, like writing that newspaper thing, you know,

821
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,120
where she writes words of wisdom.

822
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,840
Like he's just sitting there writing, like a penny saved is a penny earned.

823
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,440
He just sat there and would just make stuff up like that.

824
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
He was basically Dr. Demento back then.

825
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
He was a bit of a fried gossip.

826
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Mm-hmm.

827
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,640
He was busted as fuck too.

828
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,140
Yeah, he was mad ugly too.

829
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,140
Oh yeah.

830
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
Thomas Jefferson.

831
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,720
Jefferson was getting it in real quick.

832
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Oh yeah.

833
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
Fine as hell.

834
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,080
Yeah, he had it on lock.

835
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Yeah.

836
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Right?

837
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,080
Yeah, absolutely.

838
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Yeah.

839
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,080
Definitely.

840
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,280
Over there in, what's his house called?

841
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,280
Jefferson Manor?

842
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,280
No.

843
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Vernon, Mount Vernon.

844
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,920
No, that's, that's, wait, maybe it is Mount Vernon.

845
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:01,160
Jefferson Street. No, no, he had a French name. Al Vernon was Washington's. Oh, Lafayette.

846
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,560
No, that was his friend. Was it? You know what I'm talking about. I know you're talking about

847
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,680
it. It's in Virginia. Is Ponce de Lafayette, is that a person? I don't fucking know, man.

848
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,760
Marquis de Ponce de Leon. Got a couple of Hamilton listeners among us, huh? No, a couple

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,800
Yeah, yesterday.

852
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
Oh!

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Where we had to make these things.

861
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,800
They're called bottle guys.

862
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,800
And someone made Marquis de Lafayette.

863
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,800
So we had to make bottle guys, and then someone

864
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,960
and someone told me about bottleguy.com.

865
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,760
- What's bottleguy.com?

866
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,600
- Pull up bottleguy.

867
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,960
- Is that like one man, one jar type thing?

868
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,520
- Yeah, it's like a guy in a field,

869
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,600
it's just a JPEG of a guy in a field,

870
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,720
whole 40 ounce of beer in his asshole.

871
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,640
- Oh, maybe we've talked about this,

872
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,400
but I can watch any shock video like that

873
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,840
unless the sound is on.

874
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,800
- Yeah, it's just a JPEG, it's one of the funniest things.

875
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,640
- I can watch any--

876
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,160
- 'Cause it used to load super slow.

877
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,160
I can watch any video of a guy getting exploded with a piece of dynamite.

878
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,760
Yeah, like the horse versus the train.

879
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
Yeah, donkey versus...

880
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Donkey hit to train, train hit to donkey.

881
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Train hit to donkey, yeah.

882
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Train hit donkey, Pat.

883
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,760
But the donkey's fine, by the way.

884
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,760
The donkey lived. He's perfectly fine.

885
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,760
He's just...

886
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,760
That's why it's fine to watch that video.

887
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Yeah, it is fine.

888
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
He's pleased.

889
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,440
like you I because I follow like there's a bunch of random shit on Facebook like

890
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,640
it's a bunch of random pages and there was some video of a dog getting like

891
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,760
like like flying into the air cuz like like it's basically just died instantly

892
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,360
like it like a thing like some big like I don't even know what it was like like

893
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,280
it hit like it was almost like a like when those videos are people like sit on

894
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,720
an airbag and then the airbag goes off yeah it's not like that and the dog like

895
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,840
goes flying and then the like description the video is like do not

896
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,760
take this down the dog is completely okay.

897
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
It's a good hack.

898
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,760
Clearly, yeah.

899
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,680
And I know when I watched it I was like, oh maybe the dog's okay.

900
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,680
Yeah.

901
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Maybe they're right.

902
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,320
It's good to do, yeah, like with the collateral murder video just being like, oh all these

903
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
people actually, they were fine.

904
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
They were fine, yeah.

905
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
They were fine.

906
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
They just had to.

907
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
You know what, you know the video just makes it look weird.

908
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
We were dropping fireworks.

909
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,400
We were dropping fireworks and presents.

910
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,080
They're running around in circles like when people are having so much fun that they run

911
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,080
around in a circle.

912
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:45,180
Yeah, it's yes, they're fine. They're okay. They're listening to La Cucaracha down there. Yeah, we thought it was Mexico. We're bringing pinatas to them

913
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,740
Yeah, that is everybody's favorite song in Mexico. Yeah, I've confirmed this with a lot of people

914
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:56,600
Dude, imagine if you could walk anywhere and hear your favorite song just from traffic wouldn't that be amazing just from people hawking their horn

915
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,720
Yeah

916
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,640
It's it's like if in the American equivalent so La Cucaracha is the Mexican one of those in Tampa happy birthday

917
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,560
Absolutely. I mean imagine you walk down the street and everybody is honking at each other

918
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,040
but just so that they can hear the national anthem again. You know, because that's what

919
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,080
the La Cucaracha is as well. The national anthem of Mexico. And everything else that's down

920
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,080
there.

921
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
I thought it was live in La Vida Loca.

922
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,080
Huh?

923
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,240
I thought it was live in La Vida Loca.

924
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
No, that's the national anthem of Shrek.

925
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,400
Oh, yeah, Far Far Away.

926
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,280
Far Far Away, that's the national anthem.

927
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,640
I don't know, because when they pull up, they play Funky Town.

928
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:44,240
No, but when they have the big party at the end when they all sing together.

929
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
They sing Livin' La Vida Loca.

930
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
And Puss in Boots and Shrek and the Donkey and Pinocchio.

931
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Wait, what's the song that Donkey sings with the dragon?

932
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Is that...

933
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,240
That's uh, in which, in Swamp Idol?

934
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Swamp Idol?

935
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
You remember from the DVD?

936
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Oh, Swamp Idol, yeah.

937
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
It might have been Swamp Idol.

938
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
What do they sing in Swamp Idol?

939
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:10,240
I forget what they sing together in Swamp Idol.

940
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
How did you remember? How did you pull Swamp Idol?

941
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Swamp Idol sounds like a Dark Souls item.

942
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Yeah.

943
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Swamp Idol, they got Simon Cowell in it.

944
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
No way.

945
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
They do.

946
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Yeah.

947
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,240
And if you pick someone who isn't a main character to win.

948
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,240
You remember when they pulled people off the stage with the big hook?

949
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Did they say fuck in Shrek?

950
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
They do.

951
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
I kinda have...

952
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
I wanna fuck this donkey!

953
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
They don't say?

954
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
You ain't gonna fuck me, Shrek!

955
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
You ain't gonna fuck me, Shrek!

956
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,240
I'm gonna fuck your ass!

957
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Yes!

958
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
It's gonna happen!

959
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:47,240
And I've got a turtle head poking out!

960
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,240
And I ate a baby!

961
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,240
Cause they are the same voice!

962
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Shrek and Fat Master are the same voice!

963
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Yeah, they are!

964
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Remember, he does curse a little much for me in that movie.

965
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,440
He says yeah, he's got a he can swear. He's an ogre. He said I had to save me ass

966
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,040
Nah, remember that I was a double entendre

967
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,600
This makes it even more. It's twice as foul. Yeah. Yeah, I

968
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:20,880
Wish Fiona never turned into an episode in donkey voice. No, I'm not gonna do the donkey

969
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,920
I did I hit my maximum until I put on this red fox shirt. Then you got to see me turn to it

970
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,480
told me

971
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,140
I'm gonna turn to the old me. I just heard like Shrek again and make you do that. No, I'm not gonna do donkey voice

972
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,680
No, you'll see the holes

973
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,160
It sounded perfect the first time the the cracks will start to appear if I try to say anything else

974
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,560
Same I'm making waffles, please. I'll make you waffle. Yeah

975
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:52,000
Yeah, yeah, but I love to do that I love to do that Eddie Murphy

976
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,960
Now make waffles

977
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,960
I don't really like waffles that much.

978
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
I like waffles but I don't want...

979
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,960
You're... oh man.

980
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
Pancakes are good.

981
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,960
Pancakes...

982
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
I like pancakes.

983
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Compared to waffles.

984
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,460
Earlier I said I'd eat candy corn out of the toilet and I just said that I'm a pancake

985
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,600
man and he said "Ugh."

986
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
I don't like pancakes.

987
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
You're weird.

988
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
What?

989
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,760
You don't like breakfast in general so you're thinking it really doesn't matter.

990
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,600
You have to recuse yourself from any conversation that has anything to do with delicious breakfast

991
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,320
because you have a mental disability that keeps you from...

992
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,780
I'm starting to turn around on breakfast.

993
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,780
No you're not.

994
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
Shut up.

995
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,780
Name one breakfast food you like.

996
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,620
Uh, smothered, covered, chopped, and uh, peppered.

997
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:32,620
Waffle house.

998
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,620
It's not breakfast food.

999
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Yeah it is.

1000
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,620
No it's not.

1001
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Waffle house is all food.

1002
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,620
Biscuits and gravy.

1003
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:42,740
Biscuits and gravy is I guess breakfast, but you're, these are like, these are things.

1004
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,580
Chicken and waffles.

1005
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:47,660
But coming around on breakfast he means we ate at Waffle House one time in Tampa.

1006
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,980
No, because then we went to that other, into that deli, or the diner, with patches.

1007
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,820
But you don't like eating at breakfast.

1008
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,540
It's still too early in the day.

1009
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,860
See you were trying to be like, "Oh I actually like breakfast right now."

1010
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I do like breakfast now.

1011
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,660
And you literally can't even keep up the charade for one minute.

1012
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,660
No, I like breakfast.

1013
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,660
But you don't like eggs.

1014
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,260
You like breakfast but you don't like eating breakfast.

1015
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
I like a fried egg.

1016
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,220
I like breakfast for dinner.

1017
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
This is, I don't even know.

1018
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
You're a bitch.

1019
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
You're not even an American.

1020
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,740
I'm sorry, that's too far.

1021
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,740
Breakfast for dinner does rock though.

1022
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,740
You're an idiot.

1023
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,740
Piece of shit.

1024
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,780
You get breakfast for dinner is really good.

1025
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,220
Breakfast for dinner is really good.

1026
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
That's like one of the best.

1027
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,580
of the best like treats you can have. You're like, "Oh, I'm gonna have breakfast for dinner."

1028
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,420
I don't have any food. I already took an egg.

1029
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,420
The J. Kenji fried egg thing. I've been doing that.

1030
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,900
What does that mean?

1031
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
He puts it in the-

1032
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,900
He likes watching breakfast making videos.

1033
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,620
The basting it with the oil?

1034
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,620
It's been helping.

1035
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,620
It's been helping him.

1036
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,520
He has to watch videos in order to like the meal.

1037
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,520
What does he do with the egg?

1038
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,820
It's like, he basically bastes it like a steak with the oil.

1039
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,820
Yeah, okay.

1040
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,820
And then it gets super crispy.

1041
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,380
his thing is not no it's like the oldest trick in the book that's how i learned it from him

1042
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:05,820
god bless jkenji lopez alt the five the five named man that's what he would be in a circus yeah

1043
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:16,460
see a man with too many names of five say almost any word it could be one of his names

1044
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:19,240
I don't know, Alt.

1045
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
The pentaman!

1046
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Who would be named Alt?

1047
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
Bingo!

1048
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
That's, but what part of the name?

1049
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:28,440
I've never seen one of his videos, I always assumed Alt is not part of his name.

1050
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,440
That's his name.

1051
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,440
That's part of his name?

1052
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,440
Yeah.

1053
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,440
It's his last name.

1054
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:40,440
He took, okay, so his name was Jay Kinji and then his first name starts with a J, one of

1055
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,800
his parents' last name is Kinji, the other parent's last name is Alt, it's like a German

1056
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,120
Okay. And then when he married his wife, he also took her last name of Lopez.

1057
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,360
But he put it in the middle. And he put it, I mean, he's making a sandwich. This guy's a

1058
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:58,200
fucking professional chef. So he made, he has three last names. His name, what if he had just been

1059
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,880
J-Alt? That's cool. That would have been cool. That's a cool, that's an ADM.

1060
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,720
He's already a band. It's the opposite.

1061
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,280
Whoa, that's the Alt-Alt-J. Yeah.

1062
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,680
Wow. And then if he, and then they would,

1063
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
I would write alt comma J.

1064
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
Instead of a period.

1065
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Yeah.

1066
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,680
I think I'm gonna become a food YouTuber.

1067
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,680
Yeah?

1068
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
I think it might be my future.

1069
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
It's just like you!

1070
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,680
You with the one cast iron you have in there.

1071
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
Actually no, you have way more pans than me.

1072
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
I shouldn't talk, but like the cast iron that's always on the stove.

1073
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,680
I gotta walk, you don't even know that.

1074
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,680
Fuck, really?

1075
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,680
Yeah.

1076
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,680
I make everything in my walk.

1077
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Damn.

1078
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm straight.

1079
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:33,680
This is what happens when you live.

1080
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
You wanna talk like you Chinese.

1081
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
Peep my walk.

1082
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
Can we see it?

1083
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Go get your walk out.

1084
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,520
walk out. I'm gonna take it out. It's in the, guess what I just used it this morning so it's

1085
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,520

1086
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,040
wash my walk. Show me your walk. Get your soap on it. Then go get it out and show it.

1087
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,400
Show me your walk. No. You're not gonna wash it. I'll show it to you guys afterwards. That's

1088
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,920
the problem with living with three other guys though is I, I, I found a fucking apple core

1089
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:07,040
the other day and we own one knife. What? We own, we own one knife. Okay, explain how

1090
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,840
these two things are related? No, just like you know. You found an apple core. An apple

1091
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:17,440
corer. Oh okay, and now I thought you said you found an apple core and you own one knife. No,

1092
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:24,880
we own one knife. I just bought my own pan. Nice. And do you guys do the thing where you're like

1093
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,640
that's my cup, that's my pan? I only do that with the one cup and it's the. So you do that though?

1094
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,000
I do that with two actually two cups. I have my Guinness cup that my mom got me and the Yoda cup

1095
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,980
my brother. So nobody fuck with the Guinness Cup? Yes. Or the Yoda Cup? Yes.

1096
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:48,580
Jana got mad at me the other day because I used her water bottle. Yeah? Yep.

1097
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:58,720
Beat my ass. Beat my shit in. But yeah we have we have I just got my own pan. When

1098
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,340
the fuck like when the fuck are we ever gonna eat I've never seen somebody eat an

1099
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:08,220
apple in the house. Who cores an apple? Yeah, coring an apple is stupid. Why the fuck do

1100
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,380
we have an apple corer? Make an apple pie? We just got a pizza cutter too because I was

1101
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,540
at the hardware store and I saw one and I was like, "Pfft, shit." You don't need a pizza

1102
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,900
cutter though. Nobody needs a pizza cutter. No, you need a pizza cutter. How often do

1103
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,060
you eat pizza? No, that's a fake lot. How often are you making pizza? A lot. What? Frozen

1104
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:27,300
pizza. Oh, okay. Isn't frozen pizza usually already cut? No. Even if it isn't, you don't

1105
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:31,700
need a pizza cutter. Yeah. You do. Just fold it like a big taco. No, you don't need it.

1106
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,100
- Or you can cut it with a knife, yeah.

1107
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,100
- I hate doing that.

1108
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,220
- So you got a pizza cutter?

1109
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:38,780
- Yeah, I got a pizza cutter.

1110
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:40,780
So I have a pizza cutter, a knife,

1111
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,260
a bunch of old spatulas, an apple corer.

1112
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:46,380
- Did you get, you probably, you might wanna get--

1113
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,300
- And one cookie sheet.

1114
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,260
- You might wanna get sippy cup lids for all your cups too.

1115
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,980
- That'd be pretty smart.

1116
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,460
- Yeah, 'cause I know you don't really need it,

1117
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,060
but if you don't like drinking from the cup,

1118
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,100
it might be better to just sip.

1119
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,980
Plus, if I drop the cup, it won't spill.

1120
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,540
- Yeah, well it'll break, 'cause it's a glass cup.

1121
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,300
- When I was a kid, I had these cups--

1122
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,140
- Well, hold on.

1123
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,220
(laughing)

1124
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,060
- When I was a kid, I had--

1125
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,460
- None of the cups in my house are glass.

1126
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:14,900
- I had cups, and I want these now as an adult,

1127
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,100
like adult size, I had cups that had straws built into 'em.

1128
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:18,940
- Oh yeah.

1129
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,780
- You ever have those?

1130
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:20,600
- I remember those, yeah.

1131
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,900
I had a bowl with straws built,

1132
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,740
it was a straw built into it.

1133
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,580
- That's messed up.

1134
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,400
- What?

1135
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,240
- You're a Dr. Seuss character.

1136
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,080
- You are a Dr. Seuss character.

1137
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,040
- My mom bought it.

1138
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,940
My mom bought it.

1139
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:30,940
You kinda- wait, I wanna see your hair again.

1140
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,940
Nice haircut.

1141
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:32,940
Mm-hmm.

1142
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,940
It's a bit who-ish if you ask me, but-

1143
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,940
It doesn't look who-ish.

1144
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,940
It's kinda got a who-ish curl.

1145
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,940
Yeah, they'd fuckin' do that.

1146
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:40,940
You're a who-ish ass snitch.

1147
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:44,940
That barber, that barber went to town on me. I thought he was gonna fuck me.

1148
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,940
What does that mean?

1149
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,940
Dude, he was massagin' my head and shit.

1150
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,940
Really?

1151
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:50,940
Uh-huh.

00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,940
Soho.

1154
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,940
You went to Soho to get a haircut?

1155
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:56,940
I went to the place Neil goes to, yeah.

1156
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,940

1157
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,100
Wait, isn't that a place that they have like scientists that work there?

1158
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,460
Yeah, it's like a place where they can like risk like it's like a place that has like hair restoration

1162
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,420
Yeah, I bet it's pretty expensive. Oh, yeah, it's like 65 bucks 65 bucks for a look at me

1163
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,320
Okay, yeah, I mean it's clear that you had a comb in your head

1164
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:38,100
Yeah, I do most of what most of this is the face that you're doing yeah, you're just making a face

1165
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,260
Yeah, but I feel really good - you feel good

1166
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:46,020
Well, so that's worth 65 bucks in my book - he massaged the fuck out of my head. Yeah, you're put

00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,600
Really? Yeah. Oh

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:04,360
No, but duty did like the hot foam on my neck straight razor. Yep. Oh my god. I would be so

1171
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:13,440
No, I had a little spa day basically that's so sick that's why I'm so relaxed to that be worth the price actually

1172
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,920
Oh, yeah, totally. I would go get if I was rich. I'd get my head straight razored every single day

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:24,420
Yeah, give my entire dude you should just go in there and just like grow your hair out for like a week go in there

Yeah, but like I cut my hair was bald

1176
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,700
I'm sure he all dude he probably gets another better barber to like and then that guy probably has a better barber

1177
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,300
Yeah, and they do it in a train. Oh my god

1178
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,680
You wish that you were so wait

1179
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,960
If my barber ran a train on me with a bunch of other barbers

1180
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,360
I wouldn't care. We've all had the fantasy. If they have to, but they'd have to go in a

1181
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,480
circle and then the one, the last really good barber will be cutting a bad, or the bad barber

1182
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:00,440
would have to cut the best barber. No, the last barber is one of those guys who has like

1183
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,280
the world record for the longest hair and beard and his hair is like, goes, walks, it's

1184
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,960

1185
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:33,080
it

1186
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,440
- It's like a crazy, like, dude, there's just--

1187
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,160
- I'm not aware of this at all.

1188
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:40,280
- If you go to Nashua, New Hampshire, Main Street,

1189
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,800
there are four different barber shops

1190
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:47,040
owned by the same beard pomade hair guys.

1191
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,640
- Yeah, and they're all called--

1192
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,960
- That's what they, all the barber shops are like that.

1193
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,280
- White barber shops are--

1194
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,880
- And they're called like Gentleman's Affect.

1195
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,720
- They're called, everything's called like--

1196
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,200
- Everything's called like Sandalwood.

1197
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,040
- Yeah.

1198
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,040
- White barber shops are like veteran owned

1199
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,240
and they have Wounded Warrior Project shit everywhere,

1200
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,720
but they only know one haircut,

1201
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,000
and you go in there,

1202
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
and you ask them to do something specific,

1203
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,080
and then they're just like,

1204
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,920
yeah, you know, I basically just,

1205
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,480
I did what made sense,

1206
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,200
'cause what you said made no sense.

1207
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,720
- Or they just say, okay, I did it,

1208
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,120
and then it's you look in the mirror,

1209
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:19,960
and it's something. - And then you have

1210
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,720
like a fuckin' high and tight.

1211
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,360
- And somehow your hair is like,

1212
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:25,960
even though it's like so greasy,

1213
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,160
you can see your reflection in your own head.

1214
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,160
That shit's cool, man.

1215
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,160
Damn.

1216
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
Damn.

1217
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,760
They use a pomade that says, like, "Do not put near open flames."

1218
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,560
You know why those popped up?

1219
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,560
Macklemore.

1220
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:45,360
Shia LaBeouf in the newest Indiana Jones movie.

1221
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,360
Yeah?

1222
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:47,360
Yep.

1223
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:51,000
I was thinking it was Macklemore, but I guess Macklemore probably sounds like Shia LaBeouf.

1224
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,280
I don't know who Macklemore is.

1225
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,280
Macklemore.

1226
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:55,280
I don't know who that is.

1227
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,280
(singing)

1228
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,640
Do you remember that song?

1229
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,040
What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what,

1230
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
Well, I was thinking of the other one.

1231
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,040
What's the other one?

1232
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
The gay one.

1233
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,040
It would make sense that you know that one.

1234
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,040
Yeah.

1235
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
That song actually was Mad Beautiful.

1236
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
I only know the straight one.

1237
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
Thrift shop.

1238
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,040
The one about being...

1239
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,040
That song was Mad Beautiful and it brought me to tears, but okay.

1240
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:15,040
The one about being so straight.

1241
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,040
Patrick really loves listening to a song about a third grader who thinks he's gay.

1242
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:22,040
[laughter]

1243
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,040
Yep.

1244
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,040
Do you have your piano?

1245
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:26,040
We're back again.

1246
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,040
My keyboard?

1247
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,040
I learned that in high school.

1248
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,040
You learned...

1249
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:31,280
I learned how to play Same Love because I thought it was funny.

1250
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,840
Thought it was really funny.

1251
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,520
Yeah, we were like, "Guys, look! Guys, listen!"

1252
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,160
I think it was more, you learn it like,

1253
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,040
you learn it like how a hunter learns how to use a bird call.

1254
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,840
Yeah.

1255
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:51,520
Going into like, going into like, that fucking evil place we went to with the piano

1256
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,400
and just like playing Same Love over and over again.

1257
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,240
Evil place we went to with a piano?

1258
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,760
The Russian place.

1259
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

1260
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,920
Remember we walked in, there's a dude.

1261
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:03,920
Oh yeah, okay.

1262
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,680
It was playing that Joe Jackson song and the dude was just freestyling on the piano but

1263
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,040
it was so clear he had no idea how to play the piano.

1264
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,040
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

1265
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,920
Yeah, going in there only playing Same Love to attract gay men.

1266
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,000
I'm trying to relearn how to play the piano.

1267
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Yeah.

1268
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
It's pretty tough.

1269
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
It's difficult.

1270
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,640
I have really small hands.

1271
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,240
I never could make my hands do different things, my two hands.

1272
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,240
Really?

1273
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,200
That was my issue when I tried to play the piano.

1274
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,040
Yeah, but you're stupid.

1275
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,400
Yeah, I know. I can't play. Actually, I can play a little bit of piano, but...

1276
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,040
No, other hand.

1277
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,160
Oh my god, we're comparing hand sizes.

1278
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,280
Look, he's got big hands.

1279
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,560
He does have really big hands.

1280
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:38,800
Yeah.

1281
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,400
That means you got a big long cock.

1282
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,160
No.

1283
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,000
Oh, you have small hands.

1284
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,320
Yeah.

1285
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,200
Oh, I didn't know that.

1286
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,320
Wow, your hands are tiny.

1287
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,640
You guys didn't know that? I have really small hands for my size.

1288
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,120
Jesus.

1289
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,720
You got a little tiny baby cock, huh?

1290
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:53,040
This big.

1291
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,480
This big.

1292
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,720
(laughing)

1293
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,920
- My shit's small as hell.

1294
00:52:58,920 --> 00:52:59,760
- Yup.

1295
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,080
- My hands, my feet are very big.

1296
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,280
My thing, it's like a caterpillar.

1297
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:06,200
- Really?

1298
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,520
Does it move on its own like a caterpillar?

1299
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,620
- No, it's in a cocoon.

1300
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,920
- Oh, yeah.

1301
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:14,560
You need to put it in a sapoon.

1302
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,240
You need to put it in a sapoon.

1303
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,600
- A sap, are you trying to say a saporo?

1304
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,440
- I'm saying some poon like Adam Sandler.

1305
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,280
- I put it in a saporo can.

1306
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,160
- Oh, you gotta put it in a sapoon.

1307
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,880
- I put in a Sapporo can of shit, bulletproof.

1308
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,200
- I had a Sapporo last night.

1309
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,520
- I saw you drinking it.

1310
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,120
- Dude, have you ever tried to like,

1311
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,880
you ever sit there and just try to squeeze the can?

1312
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,920
- No dude, I know my limits.

1313
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,080
I'm gonna strain my fucking ligaments in my hand.

1314
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:37,920
- Yeah, I know, you break all your fingers.

1315
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,160
- You know what, that is a prank can though.

1316
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,880
Because the can is so, it's so much metal

1317
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,840
on the bottom of the can that it convinces you

1318
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,400
whenever you pick it up that there's one sip left.

1319
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,000
And then you go to sip it, it's just a fucking metal.

1320
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,800
I mean, I'm sorry.

1321
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,520
- Even the fucking six packs, Sapporo.

1322
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,560
- Really? - Sapporo.

1323
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,780
- They have metal on the bottom of the six pack?

1324
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,760
- No, like the--

1325
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,080
- Something about you makes me think

1326
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,480
you might like Sapporo.

1327
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,520
- Yeah, what is it?

1328
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,360
- Sapporo. - No idea.

1329
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,880
- Is that how you say it?

1330
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,760
What is the proper pronunciation of Sapporo?

1331
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,800
- How are we gonna kit you out?

1332
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,640
What's this loadout gonna look like?

1333
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,840
- Sephiroth beard. - What else do we need?

1334
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:16,120
- Well, okay, so I got the tiger shirt that I'll--

1335
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,680
- Yeah, that's the jacket.

1336
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,960
- Yeah, this is the jacket.

1337
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,680
I need some kind, I need really loose-fitting pants,

1338
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:28,520
like really satin. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Some kind of shoe. I don't know. Maybe, maybe

1339
00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:33,000
something like... There's no way this alarm's going off again. Maybe like a curly elf shoe

1340
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,280
could be good as a shoe. And then I need to figure out some hat, some kind of hat that

1341
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:45,400
I'm allowed to wear. Because that's a tough one. That might be the hardest part. Yeah,

1342
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,400
New York Knicks hat, yeah that might work.

1343
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Yeah.

1344
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
Yeah.

1345
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,960
The hat that short round, why'd you bring your mic away from your face to ask what hat short

1346
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,960
round wore?

1347
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,960
Yeah what are you?

1348
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,960
You just got exposed.

I'm DJ Vlad.

00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,720
I wanted to, I wanted the joke to work.

1351
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,560
He doesn't know what kind of hat short round wore but he knows exactly what kind of pants

1352
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,240
he was wearing in that movie.

1353
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,760
It was a Brooklyn Dodgers hat.

1354
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,880
Brooklyn Dodgers, Ebbets hat, you could probably pick that up.

1355

two versus it's not even a deal at all did you get two of the same one no it

1364
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,080
says it costs $11 I wanted two different flavors from two different brands

1365
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:35,840
problem no GT is the brand wait this makes no sense why did you have to pay

1366
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:40,240
11th do you got you got scammed I got scammed you got scammed at the key foods

1367
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:55,640
dude oh no wait I didn't see the medley of tomatoes I was only paying attention

1368
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:59,600
to kombucha teas and not the medley of tomatoes it'd be funny if there's a

1369
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:04,560
boy I didn't want you to get scammed at the key foods it just says three

1370
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:18,720
tomatoes it's kind of a medley of tomatoes that I got I got two heads of

1371
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,020
cauliflower and he wouldn't fucking show me they're not for you to look at that's

1372
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:26,220
true what's on the menu cauliflower

1373
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:36,120
that

1374
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,200
air fryer. Yeah, pretty good. I'm trying to think. Oh, you guys have air fryers? Air fried

1375
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,680
tofu. It's taking the tofu game to another level. Oh, dude, I can imagine. It's really

1376
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:50,140
good. It's straight up, it feels like you're eating chicken. Yeah. It's great. Do you do

1377
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:54,960
the freezer thing? What freezer thing? I don't think so. So you take the tofu, you drain

1378
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:03,720
the water out, put it in the freezer, thaw it out, drain it again, cover it in flour.

1379
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,720
That sounds nice but I'm really lazy.

1380
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:10,000
Yeah, I mean it's a process but the texture that it gets is like similar to like chicken

1381
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
McNuggets.

1382
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,200
I mean we just, we just, we just drain it and press it and then like.

1383
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,280
I feel like I can get too much damn water in this tofu.

1384
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,280
Some corn starch?

1385
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,280
Can never get it out.

1386
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,280
I can never get that.

1387
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:20,280
I can always get corn starch on it.

1388
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,840
I can never get that tofu water out.

1389
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,840
You gotta just press it for a while.

1390
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:25,200
You gotta buy the pre-pressed shit and then press it again.

1391
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Yeah.

1392
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
I don't know what the hell you're even saying.

1393
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,760
The pre-pressed tofu comes in a plastic bag.

1394
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,960
What are you saying right now?

1395
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,960
Pre-pressed tofu?

1396
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,880

1397
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,980

Yeah, she, oh.

1407
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:09,240
Fine, tell her, "Yo, if you're listening, Pat's mom,

just points his finger at the legs and stands there for like ten seconds

1434
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,880
and then it zooms in on the legs and the legs just like go like this

1435
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:23,080
