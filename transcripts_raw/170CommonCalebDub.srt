1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,120
- Man, I burped into my hands.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,520
- That was a Jurassic Park.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,640
- Yeah, that sounded like a dragon.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,480
- That was a quiet place.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,720
- Hold my hand.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,640
Now he'll do it.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,840
Now he'll hold my hand.

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,840
Very funny, very fucking funny.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,460
With the cameras are on, you'll hold my hand.

11
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,120
But a couple of nights ago, he once again,

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,900
- You were jilted. - Shoot me away.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,600
- I'm very jilted. - He denied me.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,280
He denied me, yet again the other night.

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,260
- Whoa. - What?

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,760
- That door just opened.

17
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,800
- That is the scariest thing. - What the fuck is going,

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,640
now it's closing.

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,520
- It's because Caleb smoked a cigarette earlier.

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,280
- What just happened, is there someone out there?

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,840
- I don't know.

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,720
You want me to go see?

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,920
- Yeah, can you go look?

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,760
- There's no one out there.

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,520
- It just opened and closed.

26
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,280
It opened and I said, "Whoa, it opened,"

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,360
and then it closed.

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,840
- It's backdraft and Caleb left the door open

29
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,440
after smoking in the building. - That was scary.

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,480
Literally told you guys there was a presence in here the other day. That was fun. It was it was that was a ghost from outside

31
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
That was coming in to haunt is just a great

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,600
Insane serial killer

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,720
You think that's more important than yeah ghost of a serial killer that

34
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,680
Killer it's not a ghost is a real. There's probably a ghost and a serial because there was a ghost in your operation

35
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,900
I raised my glass, and he's just you honestly you couldn't wait two minutes

36
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,440
Mountain Dew. You didn't even pour glasses for us.

37
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,720
I did. You decided to just start tasting.

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,160
You're a bitch.

39
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,320
I really, oh man, I missed it so much. I used to drink six cans of this a day.

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,360
Okay, you carry the next 10 minutes.

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,280
All right, I will. So, Burt Bacharach has passed away.

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,240
Burt Bacharach, you may remember him from such movies as Austin Powers and such

43
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,160
songs as Always Something There to Remind Me.

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,680
literally I'm carrying the next 10 minutes.

45
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,520
And you, if you want to--

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
- What's with all this dead air?

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,860
- If you want to hop in--

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,200
- I think you're floundering as well.

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
- I'm not floundering.

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,880
- I think that you're floundering.

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,700
- I'm not floundering.

52
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,540
- You're a flounder.

53
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,380
- But go ahead.

54
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,200
- You're a flounder for the little mermaid.

55
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,520
- But go ahead, I'm gonna put my mic back down, buddy,

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,600
and you can go give it, and see how hard it is.

57
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,920
- Burt Bacharach, legendary music, singer-songwriter,

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,780
has passed away.

59
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:21,120
He sang songs as "What the World Needs Now,"

60
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,600
and also The Way to San Jose.

61
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,480
But he had one song called Wives and Lovers,

62
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,680
which was sung by Andy Williams.

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,320
And the whole song is about how

64
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,440
to train your wife to be a dog.

65
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,720
- You want to check for that, Caleb?

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,040
- Yeah, we can do it.

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,080
- And...

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,300
(laughing)

69
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,980
It's a good song, pretty good.

70
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,480
but the lyrics could not be written today.

71
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,660
And I hope that people don't remember

72
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,260
Bert Peckereck for this song.

73
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,460
I hope that they remember him for

74
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,760
all of his other beautiful, beautiful songs.

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,240
What else is happening in the world today in the news?

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,180
- Are you done?

77
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,020
- I'm done, okay?

78
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,840
- Okay. - I'm done.

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,980
I couldn't handle it.

80
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,660
You we're not gonna get this you're the wrong address what address they ordered to ordered it to one two three poop lane

81
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,060
And for apartment you put do me I?

82
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:35,300
Made a but dookie, but I do me do me

83
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,220
Okay, that's my bad

84
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,980
Man I don't even I'm not even in love with you anymore Patrick. I decided this is such a you've had such a disgusting display today

85
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,460
Yeah, yeah, we can't restart the episode you're just drinking sody

86
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:57,260
We already had the most terrifying event of the entire year have caught on you want to restart the episode

87
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,840
Why wouldn't you fall in love with me the other night when we were the other night?

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,980
We went we went out to we went out to the soda

89
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,100
We went out to the stomach is shooting slob probably because the other night we went out to the pub

90
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,260
Yeah, mom. I hope you're not listening. Yeah, I had a couple pints. I had a few a few points a few

91
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:21,300
"Then fucking sue me, mom. I don't care, mom. It's not your business."

92
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,700
But I tried to come on to Patrick pretty heavily, and he basically took it as a complete joke.

93
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,700
And I was saying, "Let's go to the bathroom. Let's seal this deal." And he was going, "Ha ha ha."

94
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
And he said, "I'm jolting you."

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah.

96
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,900
And I was also eating wings while he was trying to do this.

97
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,300
So you saved me because you would have gotten buffalo sauce on my butt.

98
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:41,800
Yeah.

99
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,120
Mm-hmm. Yeah, which would have been this doesn't take this tape is grape juice. This is shit. Yeah, but you didn't drink it as a kid

100
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,360
So you don't get it

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,400
No, I wasn't allowed to drink soda. Yeah, you imagine how much worse I drink

102
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,320
When I was younger

103
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,040
That like I bought it just cuz I saw it in the store and then once I got here I read mighty refreshing

104
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,100
I looked at the the nutritional facts

105
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,920
75 grams of sugar. Oh, yeah, that is crazy. Yeah

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,640
It is like a miracle that I do not have type 2 diabetes.

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,480
Imagine how much fruit you'd have to eat

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,180
to eat 75 grams of sugar.

109
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,560
You'd have to eat like fucking 40 watermelons.

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,940
This, for me, this is like, you know when your mom

111
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,220
sees like, oh my god, they brought Frankenberry back

112
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,980
for the holiday season.

113
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,420
And then it gets excited and buys like three boxes of it.

114
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,140
Your mom gets excited to see Frankenberry?

115
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,180
He was my crush growing up.

116
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,780
- Frankenberry, ooh.

117
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,280
- No, you know, like, oh, when like, no, no, no,

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,140
when like, when millennials see that they brought back

119
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,540
like Dunkaroos.

120
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,740
- Well, this is unique to your families

121
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,660
that all of you are just like,

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,780
snacks, like, tooth-rotting, crazy shit.

123
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,100
- That's true.

124
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,420
- Yeah, that's not an experience I've ever had.

125
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,100
- There's a few people who get excited

126
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,940
when they see stuff is back.

127
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,840
- Yeah, I think your entire ancestral line

128
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,880
came from from wherever the Oompa Loompas are from.

129
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,880
India.

130
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
They like candy.

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
In the new movie.

132
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
India?

133
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Yeah.

134
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,080
Remember you were saying I took that test, I am not, he's Indian.

135
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,080
I'm not Indian.

136
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Oh, Native American.

137
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
You can't say that.

138
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
Oh!

139
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
Jesus Christ.

140
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,080
You can still say Indian.

141
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
I did a racial.

142
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
No, I'm putting my foot down.

143
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,800
You guys can't say that.

144
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
I've never said that.

145
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,680
I've always said Native American.

146
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,640
So speaking of that, I have some really exciting news.

147
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
Okay.

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,560
For people who didn't listen to the last episode, we found out that Cameron is 5% Native American

149
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,720
and about 3% Somali.

150
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
And among some other...

151
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Interesting.

152
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,480
I don't want any more, man.

153
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Because you know I'm going to drink that.

154
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,200
I was talking about my great-grandfather, that episode, right?

155
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:56,440
I remembered that when he died, he left me a small parcel of land.

156
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
What?

157
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,760
What are you talking about?

158
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,220
left me half an acre. Whoa! And it is in, I'm not gonna say where exactly, I'm not

159
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,980
gonna say where it is because that you can look up my dad's address from it if

160
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:17,280
you go to like the thing, but it's in the desert. Don't tell me. It's

161
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:29,000
next to, it's okay, no it's not, it's not reservation land. I was like, oh my god bro, we're opening a casino.

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,480
but even better than a reservation. I am going to travel there. You guys are welcome to come

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
with me if you'd like.

164
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,560
We should. We should open up.

165
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,080
I am opening, this is my official announcement, I am opening Fetter World, an amusement park.

166
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,080
No, no, no.

167
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Whoa.

168
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,080
No, no.

169
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Cam-de-land.

170
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
Nope, it's called Fetter World.

171
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Fetter World?

172
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
There's no candy or soda there at all. It's healthy foods.

173
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Cammy Land.

174
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,280
It's called Fetter World.

175
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
It's all celery.

176
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
It's a love letter to my family.

177
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Okay.

178
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
Wow, like an album.

179
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,340
And it's also this land is next to an abandoned mine.

180
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,680
- Can you tell us what state it's in?

181
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,880
- It's in New Mexico.

182
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,440
- Whoa, you're a land owner?

183
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,120
- Yeah, so I'm landed gentry.

184
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,960
- That is so fucking sick, dude.

185
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,240
- Isn't that crazy?

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,680
And I was talking to my dad,

187
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,960
'cause I had completely forgotten about this,

188
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
and I was like, I just remember,

189
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,240
and he was like, yeah, I've been paying

190
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,920
the property taxes on it every year.

191
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,600
And I was like, oh my God, you didn't have to do that.

192
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,440
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,480
And he's like, no, don't worry, it's $5 a year.

194
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,740
(laughing)

195
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,940
- So it's worth nothing.

196
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,640
- Yeah, it's literally, it's undeveloped,

197
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,680
like a half a football field of desert.

198
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,920
- I think property tax is like half a percent

199
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,720
of the property value a year, so it's worth $1,000.

200
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,980
(laughing)

201
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,440
- But that's why we're gonna increase the value

202
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,680
by building Federworld.

203
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,600
- And also what that's gonna lead to

204
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,640
is that's gonna lead to some development around Federworld,

205
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,840
'cause there's gonna be people traveling,

206
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,920
you're gonna need somewhere to stay, somewhere to eat,

207
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,960
other stuff to do. - Exactly.

208
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,720
We can buy up the parcels around it.

209
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,800
- Maybe me and Patrick can finally open our comedy club.

210
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,800
- That would be perfect.

211
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,760
- Giggling chuckles.

212
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,400
- Giggling chuckles would be really good.

213
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,560
And this is also, there's not a road

214
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,240
that goes to this land. (laughs)

215
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,800
- So I can also open my own business.

216
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,200
- You can't get there.

217
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
- Or we could do Uber helicopter.

218
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
- I mean, it sucks that we can't look it up right now.

219
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,360
- I'll show you guys after.

220
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,680
But yeah, I don't wanna show it on here

221
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,960
'cause you can find out everything about my family.

222
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,080
- Yeah. - Okay.

223
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,800
- But then once you open Fetter World--

224
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,640
- Once you open Fetter World,

225
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,320
it's gonna be the Hall of Fetters,

226
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,360
and we're gonna see the entire family history

227
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,640
leading up to you.

228
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,080
And it'll start, it's gonna be all Native American.

229
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
- Yeah. (laughs)

230
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,600
- Just Native American history,

231
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,840
just normal out of a textbook Native American history,

232
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,280
and then your dad and you. (laughs)

233
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,840
- I mean, we should start a pop-up shop there

234
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,000
and sell T-shirts.

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,840
- You can sell T-shirts inside Fetter World.

236
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I'm gonna pop out. I'm gonna pop off. Yeah. At Fetter World. Mm-hmm.

237
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,840
'Cause we're gonna do... I'm so excited to go to Fetter World. We're gonna have the...

238
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,840
And I'm... We're gonna have... You're gonna have a big version of your head that's like...

239
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,840
Yeah, you walk in... You walk in the tongue. To get into the tongue. Yeah. Yeah.

240
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Tunnel of Love with me and Patrick. Yep. Could be Tunnel of Love.

241
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,840
You have a cherubic... And now here... Now, here's the thing about it, too. I'm excited...

242
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,840
The other... The other exciting thing about Fetter World... What's that? Is because...

243
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,840
So, this is half an acre of land. Yeah. And if you've ever been to an amusement park,

244
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,840
they're usually, I think, a little maybe bigger than half an acre.

245
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,400
- But in feet, how big is an acre?

246
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,760
- Half an acre is half a football field, roughly.

247
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,600
- Yeah.

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,420
- Yeah, yeah.

249
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,260
- It's not that big.

250
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,080
- Yeah, it's pretty small.

251
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,080
And so I'm excited to announce a solution to this issue,

252
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,260
to the small amusement park issue

253
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,840
that a lot of people are running into these days.

254
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,680
I own land, it's too small for an amusement park.

255
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,100
Federworld is going to be the first vertical amusement park

256
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,680
that's inside a skyscraper.

257
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,840
- Wow!

258
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
- Yep.

259
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,920
roller coasters go up and down instead of side to side.

260
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
Do you think maybe...

261
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,080
You should get Tyson Krupp to design a lot of this.

262
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,320
There's going to be elevators up and water slides down.

263
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Wow.

264
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Do you think maybe...

265
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
And ladders too.

266
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,240
...that an up and coming recording artist could perform?

267
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,880
I think you could do a residency, yeah.

268
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,760
I think, but you're going to have to do, you're going to have to be some kind of impersonator

269
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
because that's the type of show...

270
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,760
But I have a music career now.

271
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
But you're not famous for music.

272
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
Yeah, but that's not what they do.

273
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Yeah, but you're gonna have to impersonate Michael Jackson or maybe Tupac or someone like that.

274
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,760
So I have to do impersonations before I can do...

275
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,760
No, it's an amusement park so you just have to do impersonations, period.

276
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,760
We could dress you up in a really, really hot suit to look like a beekeeper.

277
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Or to be a... just a beekeeper suit, I guess.

278
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
And then you could walk around and you could get heatstroke.

279
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
And I'm the Beatles.

280
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
No, no, no, no, no.

281
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
No.

282
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
We should dress him up like a mascot but just a beekeeper outfit.

283
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
Or a beekeeper.

284
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,600
of those keeper or one of those ones with the where would you want to be keeper

285
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,200
yeah that's the or just really football field but what if you put a half of a

286
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,400
football field there we could put anything we can do we can basically put

287
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,680
anything there because we can just go up into the skybox how far up do you think

288
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,880
you're going to build dig down to another think about maybe hit some oil

289
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,480
Yeah, New Mexico. Oh my God. There's a mine next to it. You build it. You build a

290
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,480
crater right inside of the crater whole amusement park. We should go there. I

291
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,680
really want to go there. We should go there and we should dig up and the

292
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,480
entire thing and see if we strike oil. Yeah. Yeah. We should just ruin the

293
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,680
entire thing because that's like the only that's yeah, that's a ticket.

294
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:39,480
That's how we have to if we do find oil there worth it. We fund we build and

295
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,400
- If we don't find oil there, we just pave over it,

296
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,320
what we dug, and it's like we never dug at all,

297
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,640
and then we don't Federal World.

298
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,760
- Either way, we're gonna have to dig

299
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,040
to build a foundation anyway.

300
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,080
So we might as well dig down,

301
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,400
if we find oil, the entire thing's paid for.

302
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,080
Federal World, we break ground on it tomorrow.

303
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,840
- If we don't, we just dig out some loans or something.

304
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
- It's not that big of a deal, man.

305
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,280
We have a business, we have a business.

306
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,040
It could be a subsidiary of Federal World.

307
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,620
- Oh my God, you could set up a PO box there.

308
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,880
(laughing)

309
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,160
We set up a PO box right there.

310
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,000
- In New Mexico?

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,960
middle of the desert, nothing's there, one road that leads to it. We paid a

312
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:21,040
pave a road to it, just one lone PO box and you can send us mail. We could go do...

313
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,540
We could go pick it up once every ten years. I think maybe we start with like maybe a

314
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:31,400
music festival or something. Yeah. Yeah. I think Fetter Fest. Fetter Fest is a good

315
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,840
idea. Fetter Fest is a great idea. And then you won't have to be an impersonator. You can be

316
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,740
You can be yourself.

317
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
I can debut.

318
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,740
I've already got a single coming out.

319
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,640
And half acre, we could probably fit 150 people, 200 people on a half acre.

320
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,840
More for vertical.

321
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,140
Yeah, it's a vertical music festival.

322
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:47,740
Oh my God.

323
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,140
And there's stages on every floor.

324
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
Yeah, exactly.

325
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,640
Every floor is a new stage.

326
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,240
That's amazing.

327
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,440
Oh my God.

328
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:53,940
Wow.

329
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,840
We have a hundred acts.

330
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,340
They all play simultaneously.

331
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,840
Holy shit.

332
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,740
And you can choose which one you want to listen to.

333
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,340
Wow.

334
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,240
And you use the roller coasters to get up and down.

335
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,740
Yeah.

336
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,640
Better World sounds incredible.

337
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,440
Right?

338
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,340
I mean, I texted my dad that I was gonna build it.

339
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,080
- I was a little bit skeptical at first,

340
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,920
just because of--

341
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,880
- We could get Skepta there.

342
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,800
- But then I realized that we could get Skepta there,

343
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,560
and that eased all my pain.

344
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,460
- There's gonna be a restaurant in there too.

345
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,720
- Dude, I can't believe you're Orlando.

346
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
I need to get land.

347
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,560
- You do need to get some land.

348
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,760
You should buy one of those.

349
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,400
You guys should buy one of those next to it.

350
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,080
- Pitsworld and Doranworld.

351
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,040
(laughing)

352
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,160
All three right next to each other.

353
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,000
- I bet you could.

354
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
- I would call it Doranvillage.

355
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,440
- It would be really cheap.

356
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,400
- Mine would be modest.

357
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,080
it would be Doran Village.

358
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,280
You would have like a--

359
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,080
Old Doran Village.

360
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,840
Yours would be like Colonial Williamsburg type of part,

361
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,080
but about the Civil War.

362
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,840
No, it'll be the old Colonial Williamsburg,

363
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,280
but about like two years ago.

364
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,000
Yeah.

365
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
It's just like, man.

366
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,280
He'd probably do Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 2009.

367
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,240
That's what you'd do.

368
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,960
Oh my god, yeah.

369
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,520
He'd fuck off.

370
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
I know why you're saying 2009 Williamsburg.

371
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,560
That's what you would do.

372
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,640
You went to a bar in Pittsburgh, and you

373
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,520
kept saying it's 2009 Williamsburg vibes in here.

374
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,400
I kept saying that?

375
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
- Oh, Adam said it.

376
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,080
- Yeah.

377
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,900
- Dork.

378
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,960
(laughing)

379
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,800
- Old dork.

380
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,240
- Old head.

381
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,640
- But yeah, that's what you would do,

382
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,760
is you would go there,

383
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,760
you would build an entire kind of Starbucks baby--

384
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,160
- Oh my God, it would be 2009 Williamsburg bars.

385
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,680
- You would have like a Colonial Williamsburg

386
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
and you'd have all the like old house and everything,

387
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,180
you'd go inside and be like,

388
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,080
"Wow, I wonder how they lived."

389
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,520
And it would just be monster energy cans on every surface,

390
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,160
on all the houses inside.

391
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,920
- That's it, you would fall asleep

392
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,600
while you were trying to build your park.

393
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,440
- Yeah.

394
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,280
- We're grinders.

395
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,480
- We're grinders, diligent hard workers.

396
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,320
- I literally, if I had land--

397
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,160
- And you're a never-minder.

398
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,160
- If I had land and I made my own village,

399
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,240
I wouldn't give a shit.

400
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,760
- Have you ever built a building before?

401
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,600
- Yeah.

402
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,440
- Have you ever like honestly,

403
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,720
have you ever like mowed a lawn or anything like that?

404
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,560
- Really?

405
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,040
- Yeah, actually I have.

406
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:50,860
- Really?

407
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,700
- I forgot that I did.

408
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,400
I used to ride around, I would drink.

409
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,240
- Ride on mower.

410
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,920
- Riding mower, yeah.

411
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:00,160
- Did you ever have to do the manual weed whacker thing

412
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,960
where it's like a long pole and it has the thing

413
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
that goes like that and you swing it like a golf club.

414
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
- Yeah, a scythe.

415
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
- No, it's not a scythe, it's different from a scythe.

416
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,640
- Sorry, that was off.

417
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,480
- Huh?

418
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,300
- Planzaball was off.

419
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
- Oh, okay.

420
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,980
- Planzaball.

421
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,800
- Planzaball.

422
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,240
- I had a shoveled--

423
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,220
- My grandpa had a scythe,

424
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,680
that's how he would fucking cut his big trotter.

425
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,000
- I think it's different from a scythe,

426
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,200
what I'm thinking of, 'cause it didn't look like a scythe.

427
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
- No, you could cut grass with a scythe.

428
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
- But I think the thing I had wasn't a scythe.

429
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,760
I had a push mower that was not electric.

430
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,760
I had a manual.

431
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Me too.

432
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
Those things fucking sucked, dude.

433
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,760
It drove me crazy, bro.

434
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
It drove me crazy, bro.

435
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
Yeah, this thing.

436
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Yeah, mine was not...

437
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,120
Wait, he's doing this because his lawnmower got stolen.

438
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
I would...

439
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
A video...

440
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
Wait, did it say that?

441
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Yeah.

442
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
But yeah.

443
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,040
I mean, it's a pretty good way...

444
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
This is better than a push mower.

445
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
That's way cooler, yeah.

446
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,800
This is way better than those fucking manual push mowers.

447
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
Dude, I would sit on that thing.

448
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,840
When I lived with my parents, I fucking would sit...

449
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,960
- That's a go-kart, bro.

450
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,800
- Yeah, I know.

451
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
- That's a fun.

452
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,280
- I would sit there and I drank polar hard seltzers on it,

453
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,720
and I would just like whip it around.

454
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
- How awesome was your life?

455
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,640
- Yeah, it was this.

456
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,520
Oh, it's called a grass whip.

457
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,560
This is what I used to get weeds out of the yard.

458
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
- I've never seen that.

459
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,480
- You swing it like a golf club and hit the weeds.

460
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,320
- Oh yeah.

461
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,160
- And it has like a serrated edge.

462
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,800
- I used to have a job where I worked at a paintball field

463
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,120
and I had to mow the fucking side of a mountain.

464
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,580
and it was so bad. That was the hardest job I ever had in my life. And then it burned

465
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
down.

466
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
Nice.

467
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Probably because you didn't clear the brush.

468
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,580
Common Caleb W.

469
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
I think maybe it burned down.

470
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
No, no, no.

471
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,580
Because you weren't clearing out the tiny sticks.

472
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:42,280
No, the job was mostly there. I would try to start the mower, I'd give up and I'd drink

473
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:50,840
lemonade for about four hours. And you'd use a hair dryer on everything until it was brown.

474
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,480
- I shoveled for like, I think I got up at like,

475
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,720
five in the morning, I did like a whole,

476
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,800
it was a snow day and I spent my whole snow day

477
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,720
shoveling like, in old folks' home and then like,

478
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,280
certain people's houses. - A whole snow day?

479
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
- And I made 60 people's houses.

480
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,680
- Certain people's houses? (laughs)

481
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,600
- I know I said certain. - Certain people's houses.

482
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,080
- So I shoveled, people who paid this company,

483
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,480
I show up from probably like five in the morning.

484
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,640
I worked like a full shift.

485
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
I got 60 bucks.

486
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,560
You got 60 bucks?

487
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,400
Yeah, how old were you?

488
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,560
I was 14.

489
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,440
Yeah, that's pretty good.

490
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,280
That's normal.

491
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,240
Yeah, that's a lot.

492
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,680
And then they never asked for me back.

493
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,120
I can imagine that you were pretty bad

494
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,280
at a manual labor job.

495
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,240
Yeah, what about me says that?

496
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,200
Just I feel like you'd get halfway through

497
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,460
and be like, it's just bullshit that I'd so hard.

498
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,920
No, you know what the thing was

499
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,580
is that I was like 14, I was probably,

500
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,020
I was like a twig back then.

501
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,060
I couldn't lift, I could not--

502
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,940
- A mental twig.

503
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,260
- I couldn't even pick shit up.

504
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,980
I was like so weak and feeble.

505
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,780
- You were a wig, like the political party.

506
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,380
- That's right, you were somewhere in between

507
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,460
the Democrats and the Republicans of the time.

508
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,300
- Yeah.

509
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,920
- You were--

510
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,500
- Thanks for playing that.

511
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,820
Yeah, I was a little boy back then.

512
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,300
- For whatever reason, everybody around me

513
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,380
when I was a kid was getting like,

514
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,300
they would get like retail jobs and shit

515
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,060
and make like pretty good money

516
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,980
working at a coffee shop and stuff,

517
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,420
you know, when they were like 15.

518
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,140
And I just refused to do that.

519
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,460
So I would just work the worst possible,

520
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,160
hardest manual labor jobs for like my mom's friend

521
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,260
and they always hired me

522
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,860
because they knew that they could pay me nothing.

523
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,700
- Yeah.

524
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,960
- They'd pay me like, they have 30 bucks

525
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,580
for like an eight hour day of moving gravel.

526
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,940
- But yeah, just knowing you and just like, yeah.

527
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,980
- I thought I was cool.

528
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,520
You wanted, when you were younger, you wanted to work construction and shit like that so

529
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,440
bad so that you could like, you would have like a grizzled look to you.

530
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Definitely.

531
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,020
You wanted to like come home covered in like shit.

532
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,340
I saw my dad and my dad is like, you guys have never met my dad, right?

533
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,320
He looks like a piece of coal.

534
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
And I was like, this is what I'm gonna...

535
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,640
Hey, not based on those 23andMe results.

536
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,420
Well, that's what's so impressive about it.

537
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,840
He worked so hard, he worked himself coal black.

538
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,040
I would go do roofing, and I'd be out in the hot sun all day,

539
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,040
and I never wore sunscreen.

540
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,080
You were making you do roofing at 14?

541
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,240
No, when I was 17.

542
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,720
I did roofing for a year.

543
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,560
And that is a hard job, and it's the hottest job

544
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,760
in the entire universe.

545
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
But man, if you want to get some sunburn,

546
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
that's a great place to go.

547
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,560
Get some big red skin.

548
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,920
No, the best place to get sunburned is Cabo.

549
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
I would say space, probably, because you

550
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,280
don't have the protective layer of the atmosphere.

551
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I never even considered it.

552
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,280
It's a really, really, really bad spitting.

553
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Comment Caleb Tubby.

554
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
You are spitting.

555
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,280
That was a dub.

556
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Yeah, I'm basically full of fucking dubs today.

557
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,280
That was a science dub.

558
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,280
Yeah, I mean, I read, you know, and I know that there's an atmosphere for a fact.

559
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Yeah, you have the two science things down there.

560
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
What are my--

561
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Space and atmosphere.

562
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Oh, yeah.

563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Yeah, the thing is, you're looking at my shirt and you're thinking, "This guy's into independent

564
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,880
independent hip hop, he might be thinking of a different atmosphere, right?

565
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,240
Yeah, I understand.

566
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,680
God loves ugly style atmosphere.

567
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
Uh-huh.

568
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,680
You know what I'm saying?

569
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,680
When you say ace opera and this guy, he's not thinking soap.

570
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
No, I'm not thinking soap.

571
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
I'm thinking...

572
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:32,320
That's what that guy sounds like.

573
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,040
Jedi Mind Tricks was...

574
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
Cool.

575
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,680
Dance with the Devil?

576
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
No.

577
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,680
No.

578
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Immortal Technique.

579
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Yeah.

580
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,160
Jedi Mind Tricks has a line where they say, "Don't mess with me.

581
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,220
fly planes into towers. Yeah. And all their songs are about how they're like, there are

582
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,340
just guys from Philadelphia and all their songs are like, we got to go back to Iraq and do

583
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,940
arithmetic with a fucking, with a beetle. Yeah. I showed you guys this already, but I've been

584
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,820
obsessed with this one Lincoln Park song for the past like week. That's just a, just Mike

585
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:08,220
Shinoda one where Chester's not on it at all. He just sings like, yeah, every once in a while

586
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,380
on the chorus. But there's one line in it that I just keep thinking about where Mike

587
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,820
It says verbally break bones with sticks and stones tactics. That is so sick

588
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:23,880
The other that the other really good one is I twist mic cords and double helixes and show them what I'm made of that is sick

589
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,880
That is honestly

590
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,160
No, it's so awesome

591
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:32,960
Hey, also, he said he was rocking the mic before monkeys had human traits

592
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,580
That's so twisting twisting a mic cable twisting a mic cable your you'll damage the thing. Yeah, okay sound engineer

593
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,580
That's punk though.

594
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
But for normal guys, it's punk.

595
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
No, that's not punk.

596
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,580
It's actually more punk.

597
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,380
It's way more punk to treat audio equipment with respect.

598
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:51,500
But then also as a scientist and genome specialist, I hear Double Helix and I'm like, "Oh my

599
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
fucking God."

600
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,140
That's awesome, because I don't give a fuck about sound engineering.

601
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,100
I'm into, I'm into, uh...

602
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
You couldn't last...

603
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
No, this is literally the best song of all time.

604
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,100
You couldn't last one day without sound engineering.

605
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,180
Yeah, right.

606
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,940
You literally could not last one day without sound engineering.

607
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:07,900
Every sound engineer on fucking planet Earth killed themselves like the happening, throw

608
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,260
themselves into a wood chipper.

609
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,940
I wouldn't shed a single fucking tear.

610
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,940
I'm not a sound engineer.

611
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,940
He's not a sound engineer.

612
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,340
He's on the ones and twos right now.

613
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I'm not a sound engineer.

614
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,340
Respect his ass.

615
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
This is not, no.

616
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
He's pulling up-

617
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,340
I'm a hobbyist.

618
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,380
He's pulling up a sound right now.

619
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,980
I respect everything Cameron does, but I have to say what he does is barely anything.

620
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
He does almost nothing.

621
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,940
He sits there and he presses the button.

622
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,940
What are you talking about?

623
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,500
He's doing, look, he's about to pull up a sound-

624
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,060
I'm the guy in Slipknot who just dances on the stage.

625
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
I don't do anything.

626
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:44,540
thing Jamie Baz from Happy Monday same vibes but he just bought them drugs what

627
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,420
are you talking about the guy at Bez or Baz or something I've been digging into

628
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:52,380
grace ever since I was living in space before the rat race before monkeys had

629
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,540
human traits I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology performed lobotomies

630
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,180
with telekinetic psychology dude that is so awesome invented the mic so I could

631
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,860
start blessing it chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist many

632
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Many men have tried to shake us, but I twist my chords to double helixes and show 'em what I'm made of.

633
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,860
This is how powerful rap can be.

634
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Isn't this incredible?

635
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,860
If you're a rapper who can't say the N-word, this is the kind of stuff that you do.

636
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
It's so awesome.

637
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,860
I buckle knees like leg braces, cast a spell of instrumentalness on all you MCs who hate us.

638
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,860
Wow. Amazing.

639
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
A spell of instrumentalness.

640
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,860
Amazing. Incredible.

641
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,860
Yeah, it is funny seeing the filler words that they'd use instead of the N-word, though.

642
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,860
MCs, cousin.

643
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,340
I put a kick in the back bones of clones with microphones

644
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah, cousin rappers. It's just so funny man rappers. Yeah, Vinny Paz definitely says rappers

645
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,500
That's his that's his one. Okay the last one

646
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,900
I'm gonna read meant to put you away with a pencil pistol official 16 line the rhyme missile

647
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,540
Shit the rhyme missile

648
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,700
The rhyme missile the run I am kind of terrified of what's gonna happen with the rhyme missile. I think that we all this Russian

649
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,060
Stuff I think that we try to rhyme one of their fucking words

650
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:14,100
What is that that was more kind of Swedish, oh yeah, yeah, you did Swedish chef, right?

651
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:24,980
You said yeah the Russians go heat up organoid

652
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,620
You did I did not do that you did

653
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:41,080
We should start a rap trio of consciousness lyrical hip-hop and then all transcendental meditation base

654
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
I would all the chef

655
00:25:43,080 --> 00:26:03,600
It's amazing is when a rapper like that samples something like very

656
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Cerebral like Beethoven's fifth. Yeah, that's when you know you're like, oh wait

657
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,280
We could say you know that we're like or like a garage band loop cuz you know that when they sample Beethoven

658
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
You know they were sitting around just fucking

659
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:23,160
That was was that like oh

660
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,800
three to like

661
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,480
2008

662
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
2008 we should do a

663
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,320
This guy's this guy knows I told you the eras. No I told you

664
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,800
- Era?

665
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,480
- No, 'cause it's different types of sound engineering.

666
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
- Yeah, you're into eras.

667
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,520
- Sound engineering stuff.

668
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,340
- I don't give a fuck about eras.

669
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't know what time anything happened.

670
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,640
All I know is that Logic is the greatest rapper ever.

671
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,920
- We should make, okay, we're gonna make a rap group

672
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,240
and we'll do conscious hip hop,

673
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,200
but we'll tell the entire Bible.

674
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,040
- Yeah. - Yeah.

675
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,880
- We'll tell the Bible. - That's a good idea.

676
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,960
- And we'll sample Bittersweet Symphony.

677
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,800
- And then it'll be, but people--

678
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,760
- Be careful.

679
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,600
- Why? - Why?

680
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,520
- Careful with that sample.

681
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,360
- Why? - Why?

682
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,460
- Could get sued.

683
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,880
- We won't get sued 'cause we're conscious.

684
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,760
sued for anything these days.

685
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,640
The verb does not see a single penny.

686
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,960
If they tried to sue us, we'd be like, "You want to sue someone who's trying to spread

687
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,480
conscious messages about the Bible?"

688
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,960
You know who loves conscious rap in the Bible is the Rolling Stones.

689
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,040
They love that.

690
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,720
If they try to sue us for Bittersweet Symphony, they'll step back.

691
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,680
How does Bittersweet Symphony go?

692
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,840
(humming)

693
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:34,040
- Oh, that's Rolling Stones.

694
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,520
- That is, so the sample is,

695
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,800
it's not even Rolling Stones,

696
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,260
it's an orchestrated version of one of their song

697
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,020
the last time, I think.

698
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,400
- Oh, I-- - And then because

699
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,320
it was like their melody. - I thought that was

700
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,720
the Kumon Learning Center commercial song.

701
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,600
(laughing)

702
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,520
I really did.

703
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,840
- Well, that might be, I don't know.

704
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,840
What is this?

705
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,840
Jubio is just trying to distract you.

706
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I know. Fuck. He's trying to distract you again. He got you again.

707
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
It sucks that he's my manager now.

708
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,840
Yeah. As a musician.

709
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,840
You think, should we let him manage our new supergroup?

710
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,840
He's gonna be like...

711
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,840
No. No. Because of what he's doing to me right now.

712
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
I gotta pay for my own glitter and my own makeup.

713
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Really?

714
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,840
He's making me... That's fucked!

715
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,840
So what Jubio thinks...

716
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
This is his prediction.

717
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
That in

718
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
2023

719
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:34,440
Glamrock is gonna be a big he's gonna come back. So you're trying to he's trying to yeah

720
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,880
He's trying to make me dress up like a glam rock star like Motley Crue. Well, Tommy Lee's on Twitter now

721
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,480
He's good walls and stuff. Yeah, so like yeah, everyone's like, okay. This is the glam rock lifestyle. I can get behind this

722
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,400
This is funny. I looked up some pictures of Tommy Lee's fucking penis the other day

723
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,520
Yeah, that guy was packing a fucking serious burrito down there. Why'd you look up his penis just see it? Okay

724
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
All right, yeah, that's

725
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,960
Yet another comic

726
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,920
No nuts, I don't follow him his wife took a photo of his nuts

727
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:16,960
His wife is a stand-up comedian if she does jokes about my fucking husband's cock is so big it destroys my pussy

728
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,760
Does she his wife is that vine star remember Jenna Marley Furlan? No, really?

729
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,200
Yeah, he married Brittany Furlan and she makes a bunch of videos about how Pamela Anderson must hate her

730
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,120
Pamela Anderson probably just doesn't think about anything. No

731
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:44,360
She reacts to stimulus like an amoeba yeah, yeah, like yeah, the light the light changes in the room and she and she moves a little bit

732
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:50,860
I'm gonna do this. I spots you're gonna defend her. I'm gonna defend her and say that she doesn't you're not gonna be able to

733
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
defend her from me. Yeah, I will.

734
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
(laughter)

735
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
What the hell?

736
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I'd run through armies to just rip her apart

737
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,860
and destroy her. Oh, alright.

738
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
That's the vibes you guys give off.

739
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
I would be doing a Mortal Kombat create your own fatality.

740
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Like, not even one of the cool ones, one of the really

741
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
lame ones where they did the system where it's like, if you

742
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,860
press circle, you rip off his arm. If you press

743
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,860
X, you rip off his leg. And the thing is,

744
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
she's so fake, she probably has fake arms too.

745
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
Yeah, I wouldn't hurt her at all. She probably got fake, yeah, she would

746
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,860
use ripped stuff on her. She probably doesn't even exist.

747
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:25,660
Material range philosophically she probably isn't anything basically a fucking ship that one ship that

748
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,060
We don't know about yeah the ghost ship

749
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:28,380
No

750
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,380
That one freaky ship the thesis the ship of the chalice is shit

751
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,220
Just like I said this ship of crazy ship of theseus the ship of craziness

752
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,020
Ship of thesaurus you got to get think of a different ship bitch. Yeah, I'm saying the same thing

753
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,220
That's the ship that he's talking about the ship

754
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:49,860
Did you just do this that wasn't he did chatterbox and and you didn't even do this is what you're doing this yeah

755
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:56,580
I know you didn't even reference it. Yeah, so this was an original thought that he had was that this is you oh my god

756
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:04,580
You move your lips and you move your lips or your tongue tongue

757
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:10,500
Yeah, my teeth. I'm gonna say lips you move your teeth more than anything in your body is that true?

758
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,940
That's most of the words in your mouth come out of your teeth. What do you say? That's kind of you're sounding poetic

759
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,100
So I'd like to continue this this strand

760
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:27,720
You know you're most and you got venomous fangs like a snake. Oh things you say I

761
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,260
Yeah, my all your words and poison. I mean and

762
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:39,560
Venomous you think he's mean and venomous. No. I just think he has snake trick trick characteristics tricks snake trick characteristics

763
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:47,740
Character tricks character. I think that the realization that the pitch-black had 91 milligrams. Yeah too much pitch-black

764
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,740
I think I've had too much diarrhea

765
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:55,460
Caffeine before the episode and now it was it was sand I've been pretty loopy this whole time

766
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,980
I was having wet dryness coming out of me. Yeah, that's the work when your shit feels like sand. Yeah

767
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,300
It was full sand. I like to kneeling your shit

768
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,380
No, and it comes out feel it on your butt you feel it on your body when it comes out

769
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:15,180
I can not tell what my poop is going to look like when I poop it out, usually.

770
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,100
So you are not in tune with your body.

771
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,140
I like to look at it afterwards and today it looked like sand.

772
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,020
I would say around the age of 10 or 11 I realized.

773
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,860
It looked like sand in space.

774
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,980
I like to look at my poop after I go.

775
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,660
It looks like the beginning of Uncut Gems.

776
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,460
It looks like they could have used it to make 2001 A Space Odyssey.

777
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,420
- Those Pepto-Bismol shits are something else.

778
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,820
- Yeah, no, it's pretty nuts, yeah.

779
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,100
- They come out-- - It looks like nuts too.

780
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,420
- Yeah. (laughing)

781
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,260
Tommy Lee's nuts.

782
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,340
- It looks like anything you could say pretty much.

783
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,100
- It was a Rorschach.

784
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,580
- I took a shit that looked like anything.

785
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,020
- Yeah. (laughing)

786
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,820
It did look like a nebula.

787
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,660
- Yeah.

788
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,380
- Like if you inverted a photo of a nebula.

789
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,420
- I need to get you on my probiotic blend.

790
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,900
- I am going to get some.

791
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,740
I'm gonna get some pepyr on my walk home.

792
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,300
- I have some at home.

793
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,820
When I was on-- - You need yours.

794
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,480
- When I got my wisdom teeth out

795
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,360
and I was on the antibiotics,

796
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,620
my girlfriend got me probiotics.

797
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,020
- Your girlfriend got you pregnant?

798
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,860
- Yeah.

799
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,900
You're not even touching your mic.

800
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,920
You can't even, no one's gonna hear you.

801
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
- So?

802
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,660
- Okay, so we just found out what Patrick thinks

803
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,700
of both of us at once.

804
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,520
- My girlfriend got me probiotics while I was on antibiotics.

805
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,580
- Patrick literally doesn't wanna have both of us at once.

806
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,500
- How fucked is that?

807
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,340
Do you ever think about how insulting--

808
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,460
I would I would if I said any two guys I wanted to have sex with me at the same

809
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,460
time can you imagine let alone some of your best friends in the world I know

810
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,940
close your same damn time that's like most guys dream I know in our

811
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,060
friendship to at the same time I think so I think it would only make it better

812
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:54,140
no you could ruin our friendship if you had if one of us had one of us yes but

813
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,660
if all two of us went against all one of him then that might actually work out

814
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,500
- Yeah. - Went against.

815
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,340
- Yeah. - Yeah, it's like,

816
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,540
you know, I mean like-- - Like we go, we versus you.

817
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:07,300
- Yeah, we would verse you in the bedroom.

818
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,300
- Like we would tag team you-- - Can you imagine?

819
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,740
- Like we go after you. - Dude, can you imagine,

820
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,620
you and me, we get ready at our his and his sinks

821
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,740
in our mansion that's in Federal World.

822
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:16,740
- And then we turn to each other and we go,

823
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,020
hoo, hoo, hoo! - Yeah.

824
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,980
And then we open the door from the bathroom, right?

825
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,860
And you have one of those,

826
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,500
we have one of those beds that has the railings,

827
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,260
it has the like sheer sheet around it,

828
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,100
what is that called? - Yes, yeah.

829
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:26,940
- Whatever that is. - The four poster bed.

830
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,080
bed. And so we see just kind of a 60% silhouette of Patrick behind it wearing

831
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,480
lingerie. A negligee. Right yeah and he's turned the other way and he's kind of

832
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,000
like dancing whatever music we have on we have on some D'Angelo and he's kind of

833
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
enjoying it. It's like yeah it's swaying to the beat. It's fluid. We're like it looks like

834
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,240
smoke. Yeah. It's like smoke flowing through the room. And then he peeks his

835
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,000
fingers from one of the from the seam in the in the curtain. I see his fingers I come.

836
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,640
I see the tips of his fingers I can't help it I come and I leave.

837
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,000
And I push you out of the way, and then I do a full Olympic dive into your ass.

838
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,560
Or with my ass into your face.

839
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,960
A backwards dive.

840
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,040
That's not a thing.

841
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,280
A backwards dive would not be able to--

842
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,840
This guy knows what things are with sex. You're gay.

843
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,960
Backwards dive?

844
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,280
Shut up.

845
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,680
Patrick will be putting a trail of rose petals to the bed,

846
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,920
but he'd be trying to stall, so he'd be doing a really wiggly, long S-shape.

847
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,280
Yeah.

848
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,760
- It goes all the way around the room.

849
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,440
- You lead a bunch of rose petals,

850
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,920
and I follow them, and they lead straight to the bathroom,

851
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,120
and I walk in, you're taking a big, stinky, loud shit.

852
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,360
(laughing)

853
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,480
You're going, "Ow!"

854
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,600
And then you go flush.

855
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,760
- Yeah, it hurts 'cause I ate Burger King

856
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,800
or something around the day.

857
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,920
- How come it makes you hurt?

858
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,200
- How come it makes you hurt?

859
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,040
- Burger King.

860
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,560
- Burger King, it's because of the ingredients.

861
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,800
- It must be the ingredients.

862
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,120
- Chick-fil-A is introducing a plant-based--

863
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,320
- Cauliflower plant-based chicken at some locations.

864
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,400
- Yeah. - I do wanna try it.

865
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,920
- Yeah, where, San Francisco?

866
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,600
I didn't mean to say that. - They don't have

867
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,240
a Chick-fil-A in San Francisco.

868
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,120
- Yeah.

869
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,540
- You know, every time that they talk about the big one,

870
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,040
dude, I gotta watch a video today about the big one.

871
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,920
- About the big one?

872
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,280
The big one, what's the big one?

873
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,400
- The big one. - The Cascadia earthquake

874
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,240
that's coming.

875
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,440
- The big earthquake.

876
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
- There's like an earthquake that is literally going

877
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,840
to destroy the entire West Coast of America

878
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,040
and kill millions and millions of people.

879
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,240
- It'll get rid of LA? - And they know for a fact,

880
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:31,280
maybe, they know for a, a 200 foot tsunami wave

881
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,960
will hit the coast, and they know for a fact

882
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,920
that it's coming, they just don't know when.

883
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,800
So it could be in, could be today.

884
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,440
Could be when this episode comes out.

885
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,200
- I don't like thinking about stuff like that.

886
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
- See, that's why, luckily in New York City--

887
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,660
- There's also apparently a galactus

888
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,600
that will come and devour-- - No!

889
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
- Yeah. - A lot of the earth too.

890
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,240
And they know it's coming, but they don't know it.

891
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,000
- A big guy with a purple helmet?

892
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,840
- Yeah, and the antenna thing stays on the side.

893
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,960
- Fuck me! - So he can feel.

894
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
- Yeah. - That's gonna happen soon.

895
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
- Can't feel any emotion.

896
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,840
- We don't know if the silver surfer is involved as well.

897
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,560
Do you know what the-- - That fucking prick.

898
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,220
- The lamest thing about me is as a kid,

899
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,360
I thought the silver surfer was so fucking cool.

900
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,560
I was obsessed with him. - That's not lame.

901
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,240
That's far from the lamest thing about you.

902
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,080
- No, that's the lamest thing.

903
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,400
- That's a cool one to get into,

904
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,000
'cause no one knows anything about him.

905
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,440
- That's the worst thing you can be into

906
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,800
if you're a kid who's into comic books.

907
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,520
You're like, I wanna get the giant collection

908
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,200
of the Silver Surfer guys.

909
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,040
- I don't think that's the worst.

910
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,320
- He's the trophy guy.

911
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,880
He has no, it looks like shit.

912
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,360
- He's a Silver Surfer.

913
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,200
- Silver Surfer's like cool.

914
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,160
- I was like, Hulk is gay, Spider-Man sucks.

915
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,040
I wanna read about the Silver Surfer.

916
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,800
- Hulk actually has some pretty good storylines

917
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
that I think you would actually like to read.

918
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,520
- Hulk is so fucking gay.

919
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,000
- I'm gonna be real, man.

920
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,840
I just can't do--

921
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,480
- What about Planet Hulk?

922
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,320
- Gay.

923
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,440
- I just can't do comic books, man.

924
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,320
- Yeah, you didn't have like any like,

925
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,160
you didn't have like a childhood full of wonder.

926
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,560
- I liked Bone.

927
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,400
- Bone is the gayest comic book you can have.

928
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,240
- Yeah, that's the one.

929
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,360
- That's like by far the least.

930
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,000
- That is less cool than Silver Server.

931
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,760
- Yeah, that is the least cool comic book you can like.

932
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:04,960
- I liked Sandman Mysteries or whatever.

933
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:05,800
- What?

934
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
- Sandman Mysteries.

935
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,720
- I don't know.

936
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,540
- What was that?

937
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,380
- The only comic book I liked as a kid was--

938
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,220
- The Sandman?

939
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,040
The Neil Gaiman Sandman?

940
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,400
- No, not that one, it was a different one.

941
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,160
- Justice League.

942
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,240
- Justice League's gay.

943
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,040
All comic books are gay except the ones I like.

944
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,280
No, I didn't.

945
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,200
No, X-Men.

946
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,800
I liked Teen Titans and X-Men.

947
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,640
I pretty much hated nerds my entire life.

948
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,160
But I liked--

949
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,040
Me too.

950
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,480
But I did play a lot of Super Mario Galaxy,

951
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,120
and it would make me tear up when I went into the storybook

952
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,160
room.

953
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:35,680
OK.

954
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,600
So--

955
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,920
I never played that.

956
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,840
But it's actually hella much--

957
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,920
I really wanted to play Super Mario Galaxy.

958
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,760
I never had--

959
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,920
I hated the Wii.

960
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,520
Oh, man.

961
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
The Wii was fun as fuck.

962
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,340
until I hated the week I even I got raving rabbits I got I got my girlfriend

963
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:54,640
got her old Wii from her from her mom and then I was like oh we could play Super

964
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,360
Mario Galaxy and then she just played cooking mama and singing-songing that's

965
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,680
why that's when you got that's what you know you got to do you got to put on

966
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,160
that Wiimote you got to put on that nunchuck you just got beat her up I

967
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,760
I didn't realize you were there. I literally I just got the back elbow.

968
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,960
I only use the Wii. Just doing anything with the nunchucks in your hand.

969
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,160
Oh no, I was just playing a game. I literally only use the Wii.

970
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,160
Yeah, just the TV is on, you're watching the news.

971
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Oh, I thought it was playing. I thought this was News Hero.

972
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,160
Yeah. There's been a giant earthquake.

973
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
When you hold the News Hero, you just hold the Wii remote like a microphone and you just say like.

974
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,640
like there's a horrible rapist on the loose yeah yeah it's like that's the

975
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,000
little thing that they do on the guitar

976
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It's like in Wii bowling when you accidentally throw the bowling ball backwards and they all like jump.

977
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
A giant Tsunardi, oh fuck.

978
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
God damn it.

979
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Has hit Japoon.

980
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
76% try again.

981
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
There's like a screen of just like your boss at the news.

982
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,000
He's just going like.

983
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,200
It's also like you can do the same news reports on different levels of

984
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,400
difficulty. Yeah. And it's like... On the fast news. Yeah.

985
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,600
Oh my god, it adds more details. Yeah, more gruesome details.

986
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:46,200
Yeah, exactly. Easy is like, "A man died today." And then Expert is like, "15 people were killed in a

987
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,400
horrible car crash." Yeah. Their guts were split open by...

988
00:40:51,400 --> 00:41:00,120
so funny though like an actual news story where like the anchor is just going into this complete

989
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,520
vivid detail.

990
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
Yeah.

991
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,680
This guy in front of a house is like the people in the home were completely stripped of all

992
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:13,720
of their skin and they just described, I've never seen the news describe the whole murder.

993
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,520
You always want him to say like experts are wondering what was in the killer's head but

994
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,080
but he was probably thinking that he was going to feel so amazing killing all these people,

995
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,800
seeing blood fly everywhere and feeling like God.

996
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
You know what I want to see?

997
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,400
I want to see them, they're reading off the teleprompter and he's going like, "15 people

998
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,240
were slaughtered by a serial killer when..."

999
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,720
Dear God, do I really have to read this?

1000
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Yes.

1001
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
Okay.

1002
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,720
That happened in a movie.

1003
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
He killed them.

1004
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
That happened in a movie, right?

1005
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,720
Did it happen in a movie?

1006
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
You know what I realized too?

1007
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
Anchorman probably.

1008
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,720
I guess being a news anchor is just playing news here because you're reading off the teleprompter

1009
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,720
and you're like, "Oh, I'm going to kill them."

1010
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,260
Anchorman being a news anchor is just playing news here because you're reading off a teleprompter. Yeah, yeah

1011
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,840
That's that's be our news here could have some like teleprompter hero is a great idea

1012
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,700
That is a really don't just have to do news you could be a State of the Union and yeah

1013
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:07,260
Oh my god do one whenever there's an L. You could do SNL you they do a sheriff you do a sheriff briefing

1014
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:12,160
They have card mode after some police killing card. Oh my god teleprompter hero is

1015
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,840
There's a teleprompter that we could have and I bet it would be work with AI

1016
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,520
- With new technology, it could be used to generate

1017
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,560
detection of your voice.

1018
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,400
- Mother of God.

1019
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,120
- You might be able to use artificial intelligence.

1020
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,800
Yeah, I think that's a, you know,

1021
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,000
we might be a little bit late,

1022
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,800
'cause I think the Wii has not been made for about 15 years.

1023
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,520
- They didn't stop making games for the Wii

1024
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,360
until like 2018. - We could still release it

1025
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,280
for the Wii.

1026
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,520
Everybody still has a,

1027
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,480
the Wii is not a console that anybody sold.

1028
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,760
- Oh, we do. - Nobody was like,

1029
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,800
nobody listed their Wii on eBay or anything.

1030
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,200
Everybody put it in their top shelf in their closet.

1031
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,360
- Everybody has a Wii somewhere.

1032
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,640
Next to like a camping chair.

1033
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,480
- Yeah, exactly.

1034
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,000
- I have a Wii in my living room.

1035
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,600
- Literally everybody has a Wii.

1036
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,960
- I guess you're right, I think I have a Wii.

1037
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,480
- I think we have two Wiis.

1038
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,080
- I don't remember where it's from either.

1039
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,280
- Mine is modded though.

1040
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,280
I did some nerd ass shit on it.

1041
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,240
- Please tell me you did.

1042
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,760
- Our game will not be allowed to be played on.

1043
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,600
- What is this?

1044
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,040
- Okay, so we have a, all right, here.

1045
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,520
- All right, here, and put this on so people, yeah.

1046
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,360
- Okay, so it's going.

1047
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,200
- Whopper, whopper, whopper.

1048
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,560
- No, okay, you just failed.

1049
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,600
Okay, let me try, let me try.

1050
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,400
left bracket verse one right bracket.

1051
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,800
(laughing)

1052
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,220
Whopper Whopper.

1053
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,560
Whopper Whopper.

1054
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,320
- Oh, this is the Burger King commercial.

1055
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,240
- You just read it.

1056
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,840
Junior Double Triple

1057
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,920
Whopper.

1058
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,160
(laughing)

1059
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,680
Flame Grilled Taste with

1060
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,480
- Blank line.

1061
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,280
perfect toppers.

1062
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,920
Black line.

1063
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,360
I rule this day.

1064
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,480
Said that a little early.

1065
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,480
Yeah, that was too early.

1066
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,520
It's a little too early.

1067
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,360
Yeah, there's no--

1068
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:53,920
There's mayo.

1069
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,040
That was also too early.

1070
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:56,400
There's no scoring system for him.

1071
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,000
That's why we need to program the game.

1072
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,500
Yeah.

1073
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,440
Catch up.

1074
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,440
Yeah, now do that.

1075
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,800
Now do both of those.

1076
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,880
It's OK if I--

1077
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,600
fuck, this is hard.

1078
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,680
Yeah, this one's hard.

1079
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,800
Impossible or bacon.

1080
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,760
- Whopper. - Whopper.

1081
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,720
- See, this would be such a good challenge mode.

1082
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,280
- Any whopper my way. - Intellipopter hero.

1083
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,840
Okay. - Refrain.

1084
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,120
- Refrain.

1085
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,120
You rule your sizes your way.

1086
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,280
- Okay, what did I get?

1087
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,120
Give me a grade.

1088
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:30,160
- I think you were doing really well.

1089
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,120
Well, first you were an A, not an A+.

1090
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,780
- 63. - Because you said a few lines

1091
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,060
too early and you didn't correct

1092
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,480
even after you were told it's too early.

1093
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,000
- So great but not perfect.

1094
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,380
- But then, once we got into the challenge mode,

1095
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,560
I think that tanked your score,

1096
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,020
and I think you're down to a B.

1097
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,360
- But shouldn't I have been able to use

1098
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,220
some kind of like star power, like in Guitar Hero?

1099
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,060
- I said you didn't use it.

1100
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,540
- I could've, but I didn't know that I had the feature.

1101
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,380
I could've made all the letters go blue.

1102
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,640
- You go like this, you go like this.

1103
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:53,600
- Okay. - To activate it.

1104
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,500
- Like that? - Yeah.

1105
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,420
- Okay. - Okay, now you got an A.

1106
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,060
- Woo!

1107
00:44:58,060 --> 00:44:58,900
- Congrats.

1108
00:44:58,900 --> 00:44:59,720
- That's a pretty fun game.

1109
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,420
I would love to design a video game about my own life.

1110
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,060
- Yeah? - I would call it like,

1111
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,340
Suburbia.

1112
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,440
- Damn.

1113
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,140
- And here's what it would be, right?

1114
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,420
- It would be, okay, tell me it's not gonna be

1115
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,500
a Final Fantasy style JRPG with combat

1116
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,860
and you fight dogs and cats and things around the suburbia.

1117
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,940
- No, it is an alien. - Does an alien come through?

1118
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:21,440
- It is a movement shooter where you run through the church

1119
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,580
that I went to as a kid.

1120
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,820
(laughing)

1121
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:27,460
- Yeah, Myrtle Grove Baptist.

1122
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,800
- Man, it is so lucky that I wasn't smart enough

1123
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,260
to know how to make, how to 3D model a level

1124
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:36,060
for like a shooter or something,

1125
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,200
'cause I would have made my school.

1126
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,040
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1127
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:38,880
- It's the only thing that you know.

1128
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,140
- That's everyone, everyone's somebody like.

1129
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:41,980
- Yeah, Gary's mom.

1130
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,200
- It's one of those things you just don't,

1131
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,800
yeah, you can't, there's no,

1132
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,640
your brain just can't process why you shouldn't do that.

1133
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:48,840
There's no, there's no.

1134
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,560
- Oh, I could make my school and walk up to the shelves

1135
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,560
and go, oh look.

1136
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,160
- Yeah, even if you're not doing it.

1137
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,000
- Yeah, exactly.

1138
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,860
- If you're not doing it for nefarious purposes,

1139
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,840
you're still, the first thing you're gonna make,

1140
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:02,280
if you know how to make a level, like, is your school.

1141
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,100
- Yeah.

1142
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,940
- Yeah.

1143
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:04,960
- Even if like, if you're like, oh yeah,

1144
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,360
Made my school in a first-person shooter.

1145
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,360
Oh shit!

1146
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
I didn't mean to do that.

1147
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:15,080
I still know the school layout like perfectly.

1148
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,080
I can remember everything about the school.

1149
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,880
They rebuilt, yeah, they tore down my high school and made a giant one.

1150
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,280
But you still have the remembery.

1151
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,280
Yeah.

1152
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,440
Of the old one.

1153
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,320
I wanted to play Counter-Strike in my school.

1154
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,280
That was the game I wanted to do the type of level.

1155
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,280
For some reason.

1156
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,520
Learn some flash lineups for your school.

1157
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:35,960
They built, I think it was probably because of all the damn shootings, but they built

1158
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:42,160
like midway through my junior year, they built like a, one of those fucking...

1159
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,620
Bulletproof glass around the teacher.

1160
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:50,120
They built like a containment thing, you have to go in and tell a lady, "Oh, yeah, I'm late

1161
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
today."

1162
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
It was like a cube.

1163
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,200
Oh yeah, they kept our front doors locked and our front desk.

1164
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,200
They did an airlock?

1165
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,200
Yeah.

1166
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,200
Whoa.

1167
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
They put an airlock in my school.

1168
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,160
Ours they said you can't, they locked all the doors

1169
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:04,000
and you had to talk to the person at the front desk

1170
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,760
when you go in but nobody ever did it

1171
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,360
and they never locked the doors.

1172
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,120
And everyone went inside and outside.

1173
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:10,960
- So basically the security was lacking.

1174
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,600
- They didn't even fucking care.

1175
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,680
- I used to leave the building

1176
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,440
and I would go into the woods and smoke cigarettes.

1177
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,200
- Yeah, leaving the building during school

1178
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:19,720
was so fire, dude.

1179
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:20,600
- That was amazing.

1180
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,080
I loved walking across the street.

1181
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,480
- You never went into the building.

1182
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,440
- You never did.

1183
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,880
- I went to school for a bit.

1184
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,400
- You did not go for long enough.

1185
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,240
- I went to school.

1186
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,440
- We're talking about leaving the building in high school.

1187
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,560
- I took a class at the access center

1188
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,600
that was on the school's campus.

1189
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,880
I took TV production in high school.

1190
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,080
- Little did you know that I actually went

1191
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,200
to a fucking classical education co-op.

1192
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,800
- You did not go to a classical education co-op.

1193
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,240
- I did have a class once a week in a building

1194
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,080
and I would leave.

1195
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,280
- It was co-op 'cause you would have to--

1196
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,960
- Chinese food from a very, very sad, sad woman.

1197
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,280
- Do you know what the crazy, one time--

1198
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,600
- And one time she made me so sad

1199
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,800
that I just never went there again.

1200
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,720
- One time I went into-- - Why, what'd she do?

1201
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,040
I can't get into it.

1202
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:58,880
- Okay.

1203
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,360
- One time I went into my high school--

1204
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,640
- More so than I did.

1205
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,880
- Like in the evening, like at night.

1206
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,040
I think I left something there,

1207
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,880
so I can't remember why I was in there.

1208
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,460
- It's a fucking liminal space.

1209
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,200
- No, it wasn't.

1210
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,680
What it was, was it had transformed

1211
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,440
into a full Chinese school.

1212
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,280
- Whoa.

1213
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,000
- And there was dozens and dozens of Chinese people

1214
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
and they're taking Chinese classes.

1215
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,520
And it was a full, it fully transformed--

1216
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,360
- They weren't taking Chinese classes.

1217
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,200
- The class were in Chinese, so they're Chinese classes.

1218
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,440
- Yeah, but not every class is an English class.

1219
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,000
- Well, a math class in English, I would say.

1220
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,480
- Yeah, they're not gonna call it Chinese gym.

1221
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,880
- I didn't know what the subject was

1222
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,920
'cause it was in Chinese.

1223
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,280
- They're not gonna call it Chinese gym.

1224
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,360
He's the teacher.

1225
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,880
- But it had fully transformed.

1226
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,280
It was a different school at night,

1227
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,160
and it was a Chinese school at night.

1228
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:45,760
- Oh, 'cause they're still on China time.

1229
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,720
- Yeah, that's probably what it was.

1230
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,360
- They haven't adjusted.

1231
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,200
They're jet lagged.

1232
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,840
- Yeah, but it felt like, yeah, that is--

1233
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:59,440
That's you ever did you was your town but no cuz you could walk places you also could probably walk places

1234
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,960
Sometimes you just stay after school

1235
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,320
And like kids would just hang out there on the same on the on the campus you to hang out in the library just because it

1236
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:14,040
Was like well, there's nothing else to do in this fucking town. Yeah, you can do that do that until you're like 17

1237
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,880
Yeah, you guys both lived in like I went to places that had a bus

1238
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,200
Yeah, we do have a wave bus and we didn't have a I think there's no you've been to my hometown

1239
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,520
there's no sidewalks.

1240
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,360
- Yeah.

1241
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,720
- There's sidewalks for like a stretch of the road,

1242
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,440
that's only so you can walk from one school

1243
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,280
to another school.

1244
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,760
- It's funny that you're from such a rural place

1245
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,280
'cause you became such a city poke.

1246
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,780
- Mm-hmm, 'cause I knew that I was supposed to go

1247
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,960
to New York and fall asleep on the floor of a bar.

1248
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,200
- Did God tell you that?

1249
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,240
- God told me that.

1250
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,960
- I got big plans for you, Patrick.

1251
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,840
- You're gonna drink five Negronis one night

1252
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,520
and fall asleep on one six nine bar's floor.

1253
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,960
that's what's gonna happen for you.

1254
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,920
- 'Cause you'll be an amazing metropolitan guy.

1255
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,240

and you're looking out the window--

1261

1303
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,220
he was posting drawings of his pages that he was working on for the next book

1304
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:23,000
and he was saying what do you guys think they should say next and stuff like that

No, it's clear that like they the school brought him here for the brought him there for a specific reason

1331
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,760
But it was clear that he just was like I'm pretty much only here to talk about

1332
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,200
Because they kept asking us that they were like you have to think it was like an assignment

You have to think of three questions to ask him. You had celebrities come to your school. We had that guy.

I don't remember but you've told me that people have come to your school. We had so many.

- My high school was called the Heroin High.

1340
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,200
- You had anti-homophobia stuff?

1341
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,040
- Yeah, there were people--

1342
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,400
- They had pro-homophobia stuff.

1343
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,680
- We had pro-homophobia stuff in New Hampshire

1344
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,360
and North Carolina, yeah.

00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,960
that was like, "Gay kids kill themselves,

1350
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,120
"so you shouldn't make fun of them."

1351
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,280
- We had the anti-bullying shit.

1352
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,440

- Okay.

1355
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,160
- You know when the anti-drug speaker comes in

1356
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:47,960
and he does, I feel like they all come in

1357
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,720
and they're always like, you know,

1358
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,880
I was addicted to cocaine in my 20s

1359
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,960
and it made me powerful, it made me strong,

1360
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:58,120
and I won every sport I ever played,

1361
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,120
and I was a genius, but also, I hated it.

1362
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,640
Also, holy shit.

1363
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,200
- At one point, it got too expensive

1364
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,960
and I had to stop doing it.

1365
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,360
- I think that if I was a dare person,

1366
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,640
I feel like the best thing to do is go up

1367
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,100
and use every single drug that you're talking about on stage

1368
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:16,940
so that people can actually see you.

1369
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,780
- Yeah, they see what it actually does.

1370
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:20,280
- And put you in a cage like King Kong, right?

1371
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,120
- Yeah.

1372
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,680
- And so you do, you smoke weed,

1373
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,840
and then you sit there and you get scared

1374
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,040
about a YouTube video, and then you do ketamine.

1375
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,880
- I was so, were you guys--

1376
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,320
- And then you get stuck in a chair.

1377
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,640
- So fucking excited to get a turn

1378
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,000
to try on the beer goggles from Dare.

1379
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:33,840
Did they bring in beer goggles for you?

1380
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,240
- Oh, no, I didn't have that.

1381
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:36,080
- I had it on.

1382
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:36,900
- Really?

1383
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,520

He was there to teach us about anti-bullying and he was like yeah, there's some bullying in my book

01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:06,440
Well none of them are ever

1409
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:11,420
Expensive it was like they it was like every single teacher was

1410
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:17,980
Disappointed when that guy was do you know what that you know what the the the fire one was the best the best?

1411
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,920
Coming into school guy the animals guy. Oh

he brought in snakes, he brought in baby alligators,

1414
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,040
brought in turtles, chinchillas.

1415
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,400
- He brought in owls and we got to dissect

1416
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,400
an owl pellet after.

1417
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,160
- Oh yeah, I remember dissecting owl pellets, dude.

1418
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,680
- We just went to the serpentarium, he didn't come to us.

1419
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:38,360
'Cause it was like, if you have that in your town,

1420
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,200
you go to that.

1421
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,040
- Yeah, it's a way cooler.

1422
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,260
- We were supposed to go to the Autobahn Society thing

1423
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,080
and then I skipped that field trip.

1424
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,320
- Yeah, that shit is stupid.

1425
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,160
- What is an Autobahn Society?

1426
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,320
- That's like a nature preservation.

1427
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,160
- Yeah.

1428
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,960
- Oh, like, is that what 4-H is?

1429
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,360
Skipped that field trip because my mom said it my mom said I could skip that

1430
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,560
Because she was worried about me getting like triple e from a tick

1431
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:04,240
Really, I'm really scary. Yeah, my friend growing up had it when he was a kid

1432
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,680
That's one of those things you just have to pretend that it doesn't exist cuz I have it. Yeah, fuck

1433
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,200
Was it triple encephalitis?

1434
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,200
Something encephalitis. Yeah, I don't know

1435
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:14,520
Yeah

1436
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:20,480
It's just a disease that some mosquitoes can give you that if you get it you just die my mom and there's just that's my my

1437
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,480
- My friend's Ian, when I was like six years old,

1438
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,940
my friend Ian had it, my mom like found that out.

1439
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,140
- Yeah, Ian, it's D-Ian.

1440
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,420
- Okay, my friend Ian had triple E.

1441
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:35,340
- Triple E. - He got triple E,

1442
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:36,500
and then like--

1443
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,340
- He died?

1444
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,580
- No, but my mom told me about triple E.

1445
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,940
She's like, "Yeah, I didn't know,

1446
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:43,460
"your friend's mom was telling me that he had triple E,

1447
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:44,980
"and he got it from a mosquito."

1448
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,900
And the way that my mom told me it

1449
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:49,700
made me think that he was special needs.

1450
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:54,020
So then the next time I hung out with him I was just kind of everything

1451
01:01:54,020 --> 01:02:00,020
he said. I was like 6 years old, I didn't know. I was just like, "Yeah!"

1452
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:06,500
I didn't know about Triple H, I was really scared of Triple H though, getting a chair smashed over the top of my head.

1453
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,980
Yeah, I was scared of Triple X, I didn't want my mom to see.

1454
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:10,180
Yeah, definitely.

1455
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,740
I thought Vin Diesel was gonna come to my house on a motorcycle.

1456
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,620
Yeah, I was gonna hear "DuHast" in a big room.

1457
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,540
That would actually be cool.

1458
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,620
- Okay guys, let's end with another teleprompter game.

1459
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,620
Cameron, I think it's actually, Pat,

1460
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,500
well either, who wants to go?

1461
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,100
We could have a teleprompter off,

1462
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:27,940
you know, go paragraph.

1463
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,760
- We could switch every line.

1464
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,600
- Yeah, let's go every line.

1465
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:30,420
- Every, okay.

1466
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,760
- Dueling, kind of like a target versus,

1467
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,600
all right, go guys, go.

1468
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,060
- Two year old William Long laughed it off.

1469
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,140
- I bought a press conference on Thursday,

1470
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:37,980
but he and his family weren't so joyous.

1471
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,860
Two months ago, if you asked me how,

1472
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,820
place as I am right now,

1473
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:42,460
why aren't you reading your lines, said mom.

1474
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,280
- That's because--

1475
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:44,900
- You're reading the wrong ones.

1476
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:45,740
- Surgery.

1477
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,740
- No, you read this one.

1478
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,740
William was born at the height of the pandemic in 2021.

1479
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,740
He was just 8 months old.

1480
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:50,340
He and his parents.

1481
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,040
He was high fever then suffered a seizure.

1482
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,340
Was a result of the virus.

1483
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:54,340
You're so bad at this.

1484
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,440
His parents rushed him to starting a chain of events that

1485
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,240
saved his life because he had a seizure with some double.

1486
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,840
You were you okay.

1487
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,440
All right, here we go.

1488
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,740
I'm going to say for Cameron, honestly, 88% thank you.

1489
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,240
Pretty good, especially that was an expert difficulty.

1490
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:09,940
It was tough.

1491
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,840
Yeah, that was an expert.

1492
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,140
I don't you get a 13 unlucky 13.

1493
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,640
That was so fucking embarrassing.

1494
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:15,240
I'll try again.

1495
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,740
Okay, ready?

1496
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:17,840
- Shareholder meeting, nope.

1497
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,060
(laughing)

1498
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:20,900
Nope.

1499
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,240
- Shareholder meeting Friday the 17th.

1500
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,160
I hope to see you all there.

1501
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:24,000
- What did I get on that?

1502
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,820
- Five PM.

1503
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:25,660
- Play it again, play it again.

1504
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,280
- And guys, we have some more exciting stuff

1505
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,220
coming down the pipeline.

1506
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,660
We were just talking about it.

1507
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,500
I hope you're into--

1508
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,580
- Fetter World.

1509
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:34,540
- Fetter World, I hope you're into fucking drinking beers.

1510
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:35,380
You know, that's all I'll say about that.

1511
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,740
- I hope you like, I guess, how can I not give this away?

1512
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:40,580
- Nikoi.

1513
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:43,500
- I hope you like geometric figures.

1514
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:44,340
- Yes.

1515
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,180
- And dragons.

1516
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,780
(laughing)

1517
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,640
- Okay, bye everybody. - Bye.
