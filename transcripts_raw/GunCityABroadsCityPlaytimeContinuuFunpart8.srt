1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Last time on gun City a

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,520
broad City play time continue fun

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:13,120
I don't have anything written recording right after but I just say what happened. Here's what happened last time

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,300
Here's what I just say I got a little fun game. Here's one. Let's just say housekeeping

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,280
Good housekeeping joke recap. We did housekeeping

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:31,660
So the Brotas and Ray William Johnson were brought to finally met Bear McGinnis the head of the Leprechaun Rebellion

7
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,440
and

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
He asked them to fight off to finally defeat the Greech Queen

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,800
the

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,480
Greeches who have been terrorizing leprechauns the Greeches being the

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:49,560
Creatures that are both the guys who attach to the monsters that have been coming up in the surface and attacking

12
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,520
so that's the the Greeches and

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,120
to convince him they did an amazing rap hip-hop style thing.

14
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Patrick Yoda meanwhile was getting interrogated by Janet Blowjob

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,120
who thought he had nefarious intentions when really he was just kind of bored

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,120
and raided her room for no reason.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:18,120
Then there was a very goofy surprise sort of joke part of the story

18
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,120
where everybody was showing their penis.

19
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:28,200
that lasted 40 minutes. We liked that. I liked that too. That wasn't really like a surprise.

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,080
There was no surprise there. I'm gonna go ahead and say, because now we're in the future,

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,000
that by the time this comes out, that is already a legendary, that is not about listdnd bit.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,440
It's been picked, it's been animated. 100k, 500k, 10,000k, 70,000k. They're making numbers that

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
I can't... what?

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Went down?

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
70,000k?

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
I thought it went down from 100 to 70k.

27
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
70,000,000?

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Oh, 70,000k.

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
This guy's an idiot.

30
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,440
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
This guy's an idiot.

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
70,000k, K.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Not careful.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,440
I didn't say anything further than that.

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
10 trillion million.

36
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,440
100,000,000.

37
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
100,000,000.

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
100,000,000.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
100,000,000.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
100,000,000.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
Tons and tons and tons.

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,440
It says tons on it.

43
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,440
And also it was a lot of fun.

44
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,880
Patrick Yoda was recruited to join them in fighting off the Greeches, but first he had to go talk with

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,800
Huge-ass Fax himself and so Janet Blowjob brought him from her

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Weird secret room back to her regular room in the

47
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,360
In the lair of facts and then they went to go see huge-ass facts who said he could find them

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,360
the nephew in 24 hours

49
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,760
if

50
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Patrick Yoda

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,560
- Assassinates, in two days, assassinates,

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,280
which I realize now the timing of that is very confusing.

53
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,120
But he said he could find it in--

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,160
- So it's gonna happen in seven episodes.

55
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
- Maybe.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,040
- Great.

57
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
- He says, well, you know, you could sleep.

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
You could sleep instead.

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,760
- Yeah.

60
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,960
- But he says if you assassinate Gumby Superior

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,320
when he gives a speech at the reopening of Thunderland,

62
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,440
which I forgot to mention in the last episode,

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,360
but I will mention now, is on St. Patrick's Day.

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,000
'Cause if you guys remember, you slept for,

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,240
or you were all upset for like three months

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,240
after you lost your nephew.

67
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,440
You were despondent in the hotel.

68
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,840
And then months went by to avoid

69
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,560
this being a Christmas episode.

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,760
But, so then, Caleb, are you okay?

71
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,240
- Yeah, it's just that I, never mind.

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,480
(laughing)

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,740
(laughter)

74
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,780
- He had a plastic bottle cap on his eye.

75
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,080
- I was gonna scare you and show you my plastic bottle cap

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,920
on my eye, but it fell off.

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,760
(laughter)

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,080
- Took his hand off of his eye.

79
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,920
- I thought it was gonna be really cool.

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,260
- He said, "Yeah, I just have"

81
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,580
- Oh, I was gonna say, "Yeah, I just"

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,420
(laughter)

83
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,040
- I literally just thought you had a migraine.

84
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,120
- No, I was gonna go, "Yeah, except I don't have my eye."

85
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,960
And I was gonna look at you.

86
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,780
- You were gonna say that?

87
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,620
- Yeah.

88
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,240
- You were sitting there that long?

89
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,080
- That's good.

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
- Yeah, I was gonna say, "Yeah"

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,240
- I don't have my eye?

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,600
Yeah, or I have a plastic--

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,280
[LAUGHTER]

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
I was going to come up with it in the moment,

95
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,560
but then the moment was stolen from me by gravity.

96
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,960
You're just sitting there like, I'm

97
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,360
going to say something so awesome.

98
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,560
No, I kind of forgot I was doing it for a second.

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,760
OK, wait, ask me again.

100
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,480
Caleb, are you doing OK?

101
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh, I don't know.

102
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,160
You should ask my plastic eye.

103
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,280
It's not as good now.

104
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,440
It's not even a camera that's pointed in the direction

105
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,200
you're looking.

106
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Hey, wait, look me in my plastic ass eye

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
when you ask me questions like that.

108
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,720
Bite my shiny plastic eye.

109
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,560
- I gotta guess.

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,380
- I shoulda said that.

111
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,220
- Ugh!

112
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,060
- Oh.

113
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,880
- You shook the table, you broke a guy.

114
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
- You shook the table and broke a guy.

115
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,960
- How 'bout I shake the table?

116
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,920
- So, yeah, I mean that's basically what happened last time.

117
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,760
And now--

118
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,400
- So the guy said I have to kill a politician,

119
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
I said let's do it.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,840
- Yeah.

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
- And then we basically go after the Glinch.

122
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
- Yeah, and so you--

123
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,420
- Oh, and I gotta link up the Glinch up.

124
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,260
- Yup.

125
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,160
- So Janet Blowjob said she could bring you back there.

126
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,380
- Get the Glinch up.

127
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,560
- So Sheely's--

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,480
- Kill the Glinch up.

129
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,320
- The Lair.

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,920
- Kill my glint shop.

131
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,920
- With you, she leaves the layer of facts with you,

132
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,000
back to her room.

133
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,120
- You know what I thought that song was called

134
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,880
when I was a kid was paint my picture.

135
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,040
- You guys go into the panel,

136
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,440
her panel like behind the bed.

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,280
You still have a nano bot with you too.

138
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,440
- Scooter!

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
- Scooter.

140
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,760
- Yeah!

141
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
- What up, Scooty?

142
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,320
- How you doing?

143
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,760
- Not much.

144
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,360
- So you guys are going down the conveyor belt

145
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
into the pod again.

146
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,000
shot through space, makeup is done on her to make her--

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,840
- And on him.

148
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,200
- And I take Scooter and I put him in the thing.

149
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,920
- Yeah, he also gets the Annie treatment.

150
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,560
- Oh my God, triplets.

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
- Yeah, all of you guys have red hair and freckles.

152
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
And you guys arrive in--

153
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,120
- The sun will come out.

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,960
- Yeah.

155
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,580
And you guys arrive back in Janet Blowjob's room

156
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,580
and she says, "Okay, if you go out here,

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,920
You make a right, there's an elevator, you take it down,

158
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,680
and then ride one more conveyor belt,

159
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,280
and then take another elevator.

160
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,520
And then you're gonna have to crawl through a vent.

161
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,000
- Can you say, before anything, just say, "Twins vibes"?

162
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,080
'Cause I have my, triplets vibes.

163
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,240
- Triplets vibes, I'm gonna just lead you there.

164
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,200
You know, let's just go.

165
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,040
And so she takes you out of--

166
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,000
- Can we hold hands like triplets?

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
Me, you, and Scooter?

168
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,880
There's a--

169
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,120
- You don't have to mention it.

170
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,040
you can just talk and play the game

171
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,400
'cause you're the only person in the scene,

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,720
so you can't interrupt.

173
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,960
- All right, let's go to the bog and kill the greach.

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:43,800
- You should hold hands.

175
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,000
- Or whatever.

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,160
- So, and she turns to you also, she says,

177
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,000
and don't just,

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,600
I might change my voice,

179
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,080
people might call me a different name.

180
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
- Oh shit, the plot thickens.

181
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,040
- Say shit.

182
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,320
- Shit.

183
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,840
- I knew it, you walked right into that, buddy.

184
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,920
- You're so, you're fucking funny, I gotta say.

185
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,440
(laughing)

186
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
- Can I push my new curly wig up?

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
- Take off the fucking wig.

188
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,000
- I take the makeup off, but I leave the wig on.

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,840
- Okay, I guess that's fine.

190
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
I guess we could have some--

191
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,360
- No, I'm twirling it.

192
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
- All right, I'm taking the wig off.

193
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Okay, and so you, her, and Scooter,

194
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,040
she leads you down through this sort of winding pathway

195
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,600
back into the Boglins.

196
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,200
I still, I'm still having one.

197
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:42,440
And she says, "Okay, now, just one second."

198
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:50,280
She knocks on the door and a slot opens up.

199
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,200
This is now in the guts of the station.

200
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,640
And you hear, "Hart-a-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar."

201
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,640
- "Hart-a-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar-tar."

202
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
- "Stop it."

203
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,880
And she says to them, "Hara tatara, hara tatarata."

204
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,560
And it opens up.

205
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,200
And she says, "You go in, I'm going out of here, okay?"

206
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,700
- And Scooter can come with me.

207
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,000
- You have Scooter?

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
- Shh, I never told you that.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,160
- Just fine, keep Scooter.

210
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,360
- Okay, I get to keep him.

211
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
- Yay!

212
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
(laughing)

213
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,960
- Scooter's happy.

214
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,480
- Scooter still has the wig and makeup on.

215
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,400
- Yeah, as the door opens, he says,

216
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,560
"Oh, Mini Shamrock, are you coming in?"

217
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,600
"Um..."

218
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,200
And you see Janet just changes her affect completely, and is like,

219
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,200
"Ah, no, I've got some business to take care of, but I'll talk to you later, okay? Okay, Shardy?"

220
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,400
And he says, "Okay, you got it."

221
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,800
And he says, "Who's this? This is a friend of mine, his name's Patrick, just..."

222
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,000
"Patrick Shardy."

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
"Just let him in."

224
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
[laughter]

225
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,000
I was like, I'm doing a disguise like you.

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,800
She wants to kill you.

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,640
(laughing)

228
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,980
And she leaves, and you walk in.

229
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,240
(laughing)

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,400
So yeah, Patrick Yoda walks in.

231
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,860
What's funny about this is I don't think

232
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,280
he'll ever be able to pull it together

233
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,240
to tell you guys that this is happening.

234
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,980
Can you tell them though?

235
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,820
Will you tell them?

236
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
- Tell them that--

237
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,080
- That the J.Pool job has a double identity.

238
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:19,920
- Oh, I don't know.

239
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,360
- Yeah, okay cool.

240
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,200
- It might come up.

241
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,920
- So yeah, you guys, he enters the Boglands

242
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,480
and he meets up with you guys.

243
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,320
So you guys are back together again

244
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,160
after like four sessions of--

245
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
- So that's one day. - Party being split.

246
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,240
Well, yeah, I mean you guys now,

247
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
so what it would have been is that

248
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,560
at this point you two would have rested.

249
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,800
I mean the timeline's a little wonky,

250
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,620
but you guys would have all rested at some point.

251
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,520
So now it's a new day, full health, full HP,

252
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,960
full Techno Slime points,

253
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,260
and it's time for you guys to enter the Griecious Lair.

254
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
So let's...

255
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
We're coming for your ass, Glanch.

256
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
The Green Glanch.

257
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
Let's get...

258
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,260
Let's get this going.

259
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Wait, can I introduce them to Scooter?

260
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,260
Absolutely. You guys play that out while I draw.

261
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
What's up?

262
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,260
What's up, motherfucker?

263
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
What's up?

264
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,260
What's up?

265
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
(laughter)

266
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
What was that?

267
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
He spit the bottle cap out of his mouth.

268
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,520
(laughing)

269
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,540
- I wasn't even looking, I missed it.

270
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,620
- It was just for Patrick.

271
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,180
- Check this out.

272
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,020
- What the, wait, wait, wait.

273
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,860
- Wait, wait, check this out.

274
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,300
- Who's your beautiful friend?

275
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,760
- Now Scooter, brush my hair.

276
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,820
- Okay.

277
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,500
- 'Cause Scooter is also by the way like,

278
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,340
- He's my pet.

279
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,300
- He's like a nanobot.

280
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,100
- I would like to sit on him.

281
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:44,940
- No.

282
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,140
- You might kill him.

283
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,980
- Don't sit on him.

284
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,800
- I'm not, no.

285
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,640
- Don't sit on him.

286
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,660
- Buddy, you know where he's going, don't pretend.

287
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,980
- Don't sit on him.

288
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,520
- Around me, that's a two.

289
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
I mean, were you rolling to sit?

290
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
- That would be-- - You could just sit on him.

291
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,520
- That's not a swear word, that'd be an acrobatic,

292
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,480
so it's a crit one.

293
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,560
- Crit one doesn't work like that.

294
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
- Also, you could just sit on him.

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,600
- Then I'd like to sit on him and shove him up my butt.

296
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
- All right, you can try to stop this from happening.

297
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,940
- I'm stopping it.

298
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,240
- All right, so now it's a strength contest.

299
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,800
- Okay, well, now that I know that,

300
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,640
I'll roll at the same time. - Wait, we gotta roll

301
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,760
at the same time.

302
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,600
- All right, ready?

303
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,420
Three, two, one.

304
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,680
Oh yeah, he got a two and I got a straight 18.

305
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,920
- Okay, Scooter is in your butt now.

306
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,760
Whoa!

307
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,640
- He can get out at any time.

308
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,800
- Wow, this is red.

309
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,760
- Nuh-uh.

310
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,200
- Red, red, red, red, red, red.

311
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,400
- Scooter, activate electrosis.

312
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,800
- You want me to turn oxygen into,

313
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,120
you want me to turn oxygen into water?

314
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,520
- Electrosis and then electrosis.

315
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,160
- I think he means electrolysis.

316
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,280
- Electrolysis.

317
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,840
- Electrolysis.

318
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
- I think I--

319
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,400
- It's an electronic exorcism.

320
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,320
- Oh, it's an electrolysis when you separate water.

321
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,360
- Yeah, is that when you separate water

322
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,200
and like, oxygen, I think, or something?

323
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,880
- It's an exorcism with electricity.

324
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,840
- Okay, I poop him out, it wasn't that fun.

325
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,960
- Whoa!

326
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,540
- And I wash Scooter.

327
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,560
- See his makeup and his hair are all askew

328
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
and he's trying to fix it now.

329
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
- What the hell, you came out with a bunch of brothers.

330
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,320
- What?

331
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,640
- There's a bunch of little poops that I also

332
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,560
brought out with him.

333
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
- Blow on that poop.

334
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,440
So, Bear McGinnis comes up to you guys.

335
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
He says, all right, if you're ready to go into the

336
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
creatures of there, I'm going to tell you a couple

337
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
of things about it that you should know.

338
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,700
Oh, really?

339
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,880
You're going to talk for a while.

340
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,560
Who are you?

341
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,080
Not that long.

342
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,560
Yeah, go ahead.

343
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,840
Oh, I'm Bear McGinnis.

344
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,920
You must be Patrick.

345
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,880
All right.

346
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,040
He's the Glouch.

347
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,400
What?

348
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,240
His, we're going to kill his sister.

349
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,640
He's Glitch and his sister is the super

350
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,120
glitch from Wreck-It Ralph.

351
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,000
Got it.

352
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,600
Kill the Glitch.

353
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,560
- I completely understand everything now.

354
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,040
- I've never seen Wreck-It Ralph, is that...

355
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,080
- Buddy, what are we even doing here

356
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,920
if you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph?

357
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,000
- You have basically, and I thought this whole time

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,160
you've been copying Wreck-It Ralph

359
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,000
with this whole storyline.

360
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,160
- It's basically one for one.

361
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,240
- Yeah.

362
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,920
- Especially saying we have to kill a glitch.

363
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,760
- Yeah.

364
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,580
- The greech.

365
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,720
- Speaking of, get on with it!

366
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,280
- All right, so he says,

367
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,120
- Pop it.

368
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,120
- So, I'll take you to the hole that leads into the lair.

369
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,240
Now in the lair, there are the pods that the monsters sleep in.

370
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,080
There are the greeches that wander,

371
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,520
and there's a few other locations.

372
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,480
There's a prison where they're holding

373
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,840
some of our leprechauns.

374
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,120
- Are they holding a little penguin boy?

375
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
- Not that I know of.

376
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,480
Is this your nephew you guys talk about?

377
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
- This might be our nephew that we talk about.

378
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,320
- Yeah, and he's basically legit AF,

379
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,080
so we may wanna see him again.

380
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,280
It's too legit to quit.

381
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,920
- Well, I promise you I will have my men.

382
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,840
If you do this for me, I'll have my men help you find him.

383
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,960
I can promise you that.

384
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,640
- Okay, there's also another guy who's gonna be helping me

385
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,880
if I kill the general.

386
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,680
- Um.

387
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,720
- I have to kill the general in two days.

388
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,000
- What?

389
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,720
- If I don't, oh yeah, while I was gone.

390
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,840
- What are you talking about?

391
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,180
- There was a lady who became another lady.

392
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,180
Through different types of hairs.

393
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Wait, what's her name again?

394
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,180
Patty Strawberry? Who is that?

395
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,180
Millie Shamrock.

396
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,180
And then I have to kill the general in two days.

397
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,180
My betrothed.

398
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,180
He'll give me a bunch of credits.

399
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
You're betrayed.

400
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,180
What are you talking about?

401
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,180
And he ate a yellow stick off of the wall.

402
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Stop, stop.

403
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,180
You're special, aren't you?

404
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
No, I'm completely normal.

405
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:48,180
I've been pretending to be this way so that I can get away with a lot more.

406
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,180
Wait, you're snapping out of it?

407
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,180
I think I've snapped out of it completely.

408
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,180
I remember everything.

409
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,180
I remember everything, but I could slip back if I needed to.

410
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
No, you can't.

411
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,180
The jig is up.

412
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,180
You are no longer playing a canonically mentally disabled cop.

413
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,180
It was all the ringer.

414
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,900

Wait, wait.

424
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,440
No, you can roll a six with advantage.

Or no, no, no, no, no, no, no, twelve.

429
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,560
You're gonna have to tell me a little bit more details about this.

430
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,200
Okay, so huge-ass fax took me into his lair.

431
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
- Huge-ass fax.

432
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,160
- Obviously, he wears the Sean John jacket.

433
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,420
(laughing)

434
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,800
- Waning on gold.

435
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,840
- And I can't even talk about that.

436
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,120
- Can we just go murder some snatch?

437
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,960
- Yeah.

438
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,800
- We have to murder, okay, we murder the glitch.

439
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,960
- I wanna beat the snatch up.

440
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,560
- The queen snatch, right?

441
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,600
- You, Yoda, you talk to me after this.

442
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,960
- Okay, we're gonna murder the glitch

443
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,160
and then you have to do this or else you're a loser.

444
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,800
- But I really don't want to be a loser.

445
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
- Okay, nose goes.

446
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,560
- Ah, fuck.

447
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
(laughing)

448
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
- He got me in real life.

449
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,880
- Okay, you actually have to do it now.

450
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,520
- You actually have to do it now.

451
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,920
- 'Cause you lost nose goes, so.

452
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,280
- It's an Irish tradition.

453
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,520
- Uh-huh.

454
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,280
So if we go and kill this Gleech and then do--

455
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,240
- It's a queef.

456
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,360
- Oh, the queef.

457
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,080
If we kill the queen queef, we're gonna be--

458
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,840
- No, a queef greech.

459
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,240
Okay, the Green Queen.

460
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,040
And we're gonna get all, and we're gonna stay,

461
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,880
we're gonna get all the lower--

462
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,840
- We've avoided wordplay for some time now.

463
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,480
- We're gonna get all the lower factions to kill the,

464
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,600
we're gonna start an uprising, obviously.

465
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,760
Okay, we'll go do that now.

466
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,960
No more!

467
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,200
(laughing)

468
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,440
(laughter)

469
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:32,920
- Hush!

470
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,880
- That was the best line read we've ever had

471
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,800
in our scripted series.

472
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,320
- Okay, we'll talk after this.

473
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,720
- No, we'll do after this.

474
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,240
- Star-billed snitch.

475
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,520
We're gonna kill the green. Okay, so let me tell you then a little bit more about the place.

476
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,020
Okay.

477
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,020
Just a little bit more.

478
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,020
This is important.

479
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,220
Number one, it has a blotch in it.

480
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,020
Yeah, we get it. We're killing the blimch.

481
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,020
Number two, the blotch is a quick clean.

482
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,020
If you move stealthily, you can avoid a lot of the monsters.

483
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:14,020
As soon as I get in there, I'm indiscriminately killing women and children and old people.

484
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:21,500
Yeah, that's why we're going oh yeah, cuz it's a society of women. You know what next leprechauns all men. Don't worry

485
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,660
All right, I trust you, and then we'll break all the prisoners out you're crazy as fucking hey

486
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,740
Here's a question when we see people and they're walking in the street in this new world

487
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,320
We're going to should we smack crap out of their hands and spit on them - if they have a cup you best believe that thing

488
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,480
Is getting yeeted to oblivion you guys?

489
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,720
(laughing)

490
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,360
- We're gonna yeet everything.

491
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
- Okay, yeah, can I yeet the fuck out of this fucking bitch?

492
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,200
- We're gonna yeet them on X Games.

493
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,640
- I'm gonna yeet them on X Games mode, bitch.

494
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,800
- Can you roll to see if you yeet?

495
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,840
- Well, we haven't done it yet.

496
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
God, you're old.

497
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,000
(laughing)

498
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,520
Let's go, come on.

499
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,140
- All right, so,

500
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,800
A Seamus leads you guys to a hole in the ground further into the chamber.

501
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Oh wait, hey.

502
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah, what's up?

503
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Get that other guy back here.

504
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I played audio for them in the room and then also baby Gadd was there.

505
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
I thought you were going to talk about this when we get back.

506
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Oh yeah, I'm talking about it when I get back.

507
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Can I call him? Do I have his phone number now?

508
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Who?

509
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Bear.

510
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,460
- Bear McGinnis, no.

511
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,480
- We're going in the snatch hole to fight the snatch.

512
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,120
- Patrick is slipping back into character.

513
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,400
- It comes and goes.

514
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,740
I think I sneezed in the pebble that's in my--

515
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,860
- Yes, the sneeze!

516
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,500
We're fighting the sneeze, come on!

517
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,080
- Finally, you have a good idea.

518
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,880
- You can smell the stink of the greaches

519
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,940
emanating from the torn apart hole.

520
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,080
- The Grinch stench?

521
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,740
- The metal sheets from the hole curl upward

522
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,340
from this hole in the gut's layer.

523
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,180
- Crenches?

524
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,020
- Crenches.

525
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,840
- Crenches, stench.

526
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,680
- Passageways.

527
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,520
- Crenches, stench.

528
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,760
- Suggesting that something burrowed out from here,

529
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,740
so it's a second entrance, really.

530
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,720
But it's being used.

531
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,760
A layer of fresh slime can be seen at the hole's edge

532
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,020
before giving way to larger pools of the stuff

533
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,680
slathered across the passageway.

534
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,540
Upon descending into the hole, the darkness is immediate.

535
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:34,980
Ray, you are the only one who has proper

536
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,880
as proper dark vision, being part demon.

537
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,220
(imitates demon)

538
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,540
So meaning Patrick and Blotas will be--

539
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,700
- I'm just winging it.

540
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,300
- Somewhat of a disadvantage.

541
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,420
You'll feel some perception checks,

542
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,540
depending on the situation.

543
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,300
I don't like the just fail all,

544
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,500
or it's like depending on what you're trying to perceive,

545
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,020
you will fail them.

546
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,860
And you're gonna take a penalty on range attacks,

547
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,380
unless you find a way to produce light,

548
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,580
which is my own little addition.

549
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,820
Ray, you're able to make out the outline

550
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,860
of a broader passageway though.

551
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,700
- Okay. - So you guys,

552
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,780
let's get your characters in here.

553
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,220
So each of these squares is gonna be

554
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,020
roughly 10 feet right now.

555
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,960
- Holy shit, I'm huge.

556
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,340
- And then we'll zoom in here, over here.

557
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,180
- Okay.

558
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,900
- And then we'll zoom in sort of like

559
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,220
during certain conflicts and we'll change

560
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,060
sort of the size of each of the--

561
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,840
- Wait, these are, where are the squares are 10 feet?

562
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,680
- Yeah, but like this is just--

563
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,500
- I'm even bigger.

564
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,340
- No, this is just representing your characters.

565
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,820
- 20 feet wide.

566
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,740
- You're not-- - Where's Yoda?

567
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,460
- 20 feet wide, I don't know where Yoda is.

568
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,700
Didn't you eat him?

569
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,540
Did you yeet him, Rick?

570
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,820
I did not yeet him into oblivion on X Games mode.

571
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,860
You probably, when you punched all my shit away,

572
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,140
well, I see his hat.

573
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,580
I think I don't know what yeet is.

574
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,420
You don't know yeet?

575
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,220
No, that's not his hat.

576
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,820
Oh yeah, define it then.

577
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,940
Yeah, define yeet.

578
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,780
Define yeet.

579
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,620
Well, that's hard to do.

580
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,860
Trolololol.

581
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,540
(laughing)

582
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:56,260
I bet you don't even know that either.

583
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,100
Oh my God, we lost Badger Coder.

584
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,300
I only know the Drew Carey show.

585
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,420
Yeah, honey, Badger don't care.

586
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,700
- It's gotta be over there, 'cause I didn't touch him.

587
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,580
- You didn't touch him, nerd.

588
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,540
- Oh, check over with fucking Janet Blowjerb.

589
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,620
There he is. - There he is.

590
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,580
- You bastard, you in between her legs, oh!

591
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,100
- Nasty ass.

592
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,580
- He is nasty. - That nasty ass motherfucker.

593
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,000
- Baby cat is not here.

594
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,180
- Oh, bro, chill.

595
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,620
- I'm kinda mad that he was baby one.

596
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,320
- If you remember.

597
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,620
- I know, well, we'll use him again

598
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,260
for another character in another segment.

599
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,800
- Oh wait, wait, wait, Scooter, what'd you get?

600
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,640
- Scooter's a nanobot.

601
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,500
- Here's Scooter. - I barely know her.

602
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,340
- Oh wait, here's Scooter.

603
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,780
I'll just make a dot for Scooter.

604
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,820
- We'll just make a dot for wherever he is.

605
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,940
And if you remember, Sullivan is right now strapped to you.

606
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,740
- Well, Scooter's in my pocket anyway.

607
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,020
- Sullivan is a bulletproof vest for me.

608
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,620
And I'm not getting a good look at this Sullivan figurine

609
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,020
'til right now and I am pretty close to laughing.

610
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,860
(laughing)

611
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,340
- It is a loody coolo.

612
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,620
- Can you show the camera this?

613
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,780
- No, it's been shown.

614
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,860
- Okay, just another-- - But we'll have a reminder.

615
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,700
- Look at his face.

616
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,500
- I think I never noticed that was a mouth.

617
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,580
He's fucked up.

618
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,020
- I thought it was a good choice, thank you.

619
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,140
- All right, put him back on my chest to protect me.

620
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,980
- Thank you.

621
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,940
Excuse me.

622
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:17,420
Yeah, so Ray, you're able to make an outline

623
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:20,340
of a broader passageway with coiled wire

624
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,780
of a more sort of archaic alien sort of nature.

625
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,760
So similar to what you, you can't see it,

626
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,360
but similar to what you had seen in--

627
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,040
- Oh my God, Huge Ass Facts is a Grish.

628
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,120
- Huge Ass Facts Lair.

629
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,600
Well, not necessarily, but it's the same kind of alien

630
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,640
kind of architecture and

631
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,560
Giger-esque kind of layout.

632
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,880
- But they can't see it.

633
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,940
- So the Giger is what we're gonna get?

634
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,160
- You're trying to get the Giger.

635
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,000
- Oh, the Gleacher.

636
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
- Guys, I hate to interrupt,

637
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,840
but I'm seeing a broader passageway

638
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,660
with some kind of--

639
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,600
- Chlorus Leachman. - Foiling.

640
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,680
we have to kill Cloris Leachman.

641
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,800
- I think she might be in the broad passageway

642
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,640
with archaic coils.

643
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,280
- Okay, we should go get her.

644
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,120
- Fucking cunt.

645
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,320
You all can see a bit a ways away

646
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,160
the faintest yellow glow.

647
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,720
- This place is Leachman-esque.

648
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,120
- Suggesting that there may be some light to come.

649
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,160
So, from what Bear McGinnis attempted to tell you guys,

650
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,120
you know that there are monsters

651
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,040
similar to what you had seen come up on the surface,

652
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,920
like the snake monster, that purple monster,

653
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,920
that sex tentacle monster, kind of--

654
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,840
- Sonny D.

655
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,880
- Kind of Sonny D.

656
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,480
- That purple monster, Sonny D.

657
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,320
- I don't know.

658
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,140
- What are you talking about?

659
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,920
- I don't know what you're doing now.

660
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,720
Deadass, that's a reference that if you don't get,

661
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,520
you are not a true Kyle Cease fan.

662
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,120
- A what fan?

663
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:48,960
- Let's just get on with it.

664
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
- We're moving on.

665
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,400
- So, sort of lurking about.

666
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,140
So, and you two can't really see.

667
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,680
So-- - But I'm seeing it.

668
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,320
- You can kind of see, like you can make a,

669
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,640
like you have dark vision, so you, yes,

670
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,800
effectively you can see, but it's like still dark.

671
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,640
It's still-- - Right.

672
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,560
- But I have dark vision, so I can see it perfectly then.

673
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,880
- Right. - Yes, I suppose.

674
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,220
- And you see the biatch. - For all functional

675
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,440
purposes, yes.

676
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,600
- The biatch is nowhere to be found,

677
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,200
but we need to go in this other hole.

678
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
- Where's this gliatch at?

679
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,380
The glizznitch is over somewhere,

680
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,120
but I don't give a fizzuck about that.

681
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,480
We go in the hole right now.

682
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,520
Come on, I grab you guys and we just

683
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,960
come in a daisy chain through.

684
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,800
Come on, come on, come on.

685
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,640
All right.

686
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,280
Monkeys in a barrel, we fall into that.

687
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,400
We're all holding hands.

688
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,280
So as you guys walk through.

689
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,800
And I would like to land on Sullivan when we,

690
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,200
I thought it was in the bottom of the ground.

691
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,340
And it was a straight hole down.

692
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,720
You guys went down the hole.

693
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,480
Oh, this is not, this is just a side opening.

694
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,720
It's like you went down the hole

695
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,480
and now you're moving through.

696
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
- Okay, all right.

697
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,100
- And on your left, you see another passageway.

698
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,160
You hear kind of like manic sounds from that passageway.

699
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,160
Down the way, you, Ray William Johnson,

700
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,240
can see some kind of creature lumbering around

701
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,840
immediately in front of you, further down the passageway.

702
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,680
- If I could see it-- - That's the passageway

703
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,800
that has more of the yellow light.

704
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,240
- Does it look like-- - That you can make out to

705
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,080
at the very end.

706
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,960
- Does it look friendly?

707
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,800
- No.

708
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,740
- Okay, I'd like to run Sullivan first at it.

709
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,680
- So Sullivan's tied to you, right?

710
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,520
- Yeah.

711
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,840
- You're gonna run Sullivan first.

712
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:29,960
Okay, now I understand.

713
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,800
Okay.

714
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,720
Cool.

715
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,080
- Follow me!

716
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,960
- Okay, so you charge ahead towards this thing

717
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,480
and as you get closer, you can make out

718
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,640
that it looks like a bunch of different flat rectangles.

719
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,740
- I like to turn around, that's too scary.

720
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,720
- You're gonna turn around.

721
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,720
- You can just already tell it's gonna be crazy.

722
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
- Okay, you get a sting.

723
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,720
- All I make out is the rectangle.

724
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,720
- Yeah, you yell, and the thing goes.

725
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
- I hit him for doing that.

726
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,720
- Yeah, you hit him, he takes, can you roll a D4?

727
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
- That's not a D4.

728
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
- A 14.

729
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
- Stop that.

730
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
- Do you have a D4?

731
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,720
- It probably got thrown onto the ground by a one-throw.

732
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,120
- Probably got thrown onto the ground

733
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,600
by one's rude actions.

734
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,620
- Three. - You got three.

735
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,620
- Okay, you did three damage to Sullivan.

736
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,680
Where's Sullivan's HP?

737
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,680
I gotta go to the battle notes.

738
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,520
- He's dead.

739
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,920
- Let's go to the battle notes.

740
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:33,840
When I was in class, I used to take notes

741
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,400
and I used to take battle notes, two separate notes.

742
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,200
Can I overpower this teacher?

743
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,400
- I took babble notes.

744
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,240
- Yeah.

745
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,560
- 'Cause that's whatever my teacher was saying.

746
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,760
- I did not give a fuck about most of my lessons

747
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,160
besides math, science, and social studies.

748
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
- I didn't care, I--

749
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,640
- I cared about lunch, though.

750
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,440
I didn't even care about lunch that much.

751
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,920
- So you run up, and this creature now faces you,

752
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,320
and it has arms, it's all made out of these

753
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,840
spinning rectangles. - Whoop-de-doo, it's a cube.

754
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,560
- These spinning flat rectangles, and it--

755
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,680
- Paper monster.

756
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,280
- It-- - Use scissors.

757
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,400
- Lurches towards you, and let's roll for initiative.

758
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:16,960
- Speaking of, kinda reminds me of Super Paper Mario.

759
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,800
My dice got stolen.

760
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,520
- I've been playing Thousand Year Door.

761
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,360
- And it has the square guys.

762
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,200
- It has a few of those guys.

763
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,040
- And Cameron got a 21.

764
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,120
- Oh, you can't roll for me.

765
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,960
- And I got a 21.

766
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,840
- So does Super Paper Mario.

767
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,160
Yes, Super Paper Mario has more of those guys, so yes.

768
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,000
Like, actually has those guys.

769
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
- Natural 20.

770
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,880
- Where is initiative?

771
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,800
- Natural 20.

772
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,040
- Oh wait, then I got a 15.

773
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,880
- I got a natural 20.

774
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,840
- I got a six.

775
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,520
- How about, what do you guys think?

776
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,360
What do you guys think the initiative is?

777
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,040
- Does Scooter have light bulb eyes?

778
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,960
- Like the-- - Oh, this guy.

779
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,400
- Like the bug from Spy Kids 2?

780
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,680
- Oh, the little bug?

781
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,520
- Yeah.

782
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,280
- Is its name Ralph, or is that the name of someone else

783
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,120
who I know?

784
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,940
- It's the name of someone else.

785
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,040
- Just someone you know?

786
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,600
- Christ.

787
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,420
- Let's think its name's Ralph.

788
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,260
- I think its name is--

789
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,440
- With dots in between.

790
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,160
- I think it's Daphne.

791
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,500
- You're thinking of Scooby-Doo.

792
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,340
- Oh shit.

793
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,560
- Why am I crying right now?

794
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:10,520
- Just 'cause of, you know, how much danger we're in?

795
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,080
- Oh my gosh, I'm crying.

796
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,400
- You need to go rush to the hospital.

797
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,720
- You guys gotta--

798
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,400
- I literally said there are ways to get--

799
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,640
- You guys just ran at this thing.

800
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
- All right, what'd you--

801
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,640
- I turned around, I told you that!

802
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,720
- Ran at it.

803
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,280
- And then I ran away, dude!

804
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,320
- What is your, what initiative did you get?

805
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
- Oh, natural 20.

806
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,600
- I got six.

807
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,420
- Oh my god, it is Ralph.

808
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,440
- Yeah.

809
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,760
- With dots between the letters?

810
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,600
- Yep. - You got a six?

811
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,860
- Yep, so-- - You got a six?

812
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,440
- Look who's not crying anymore.

813
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,280
What's his name?

814
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,120
- You got a six?

815
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,240
- Does Scooter have Ralph powers?

816
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,160
- Does he have Ralph energy?

817
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,240
- No, Scooter is a nanobot.

818
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,080
- Does he have a flashlight?

819
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,240
- Scooter is a nanobot.

820
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,800
- You know who has big dick energy?

821
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,640
- Who?

822
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,460
- Jamie Lee Curtis.

823
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,300
- For real.

824
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,120
- I'm gonna kill myself.

825
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,960
- I heard she actually has one too.

826
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,040
- Pat, what'd you get in initiative?

827
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,560
- She has both, I learned that as a kid.

828
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,000
- 14 or something, or 15?

829
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,480
- Roll your initiative again.

830
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,800
You don't remember.

831
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,960
- Nice.

832
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,880
- I got an 18 then.

833
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,840
- Very nice.

834
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,640
Okay, I'm pretty sure it was a 15. I got a 20. I'd like to use my by the way

835
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,680
I already used my turn to do I would get first Emily Curtis would be the mom friend though

836
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,940
I would bang her right you would have to be the one who acted like a mom

837
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,800
I don't care if she's 90 years old stuck in the damn washing machine. Yeah, the washing machine. She'll die. She'll drown

838
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,240
She'll swim in the why the top load washing machine. She's

839
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,220
like this or legs and you walk in like

840
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,720
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of her.

841
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,020
I'll put my dick between the legs.

842
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,300
So yeah, you do go first for William Johnson.

843
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,860
Yeah, first I'd like to...

844
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,500
Crash your fucking shit.

845
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,380
So yeah, it does look like a bunch of cards

846
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,940
are spinning on axles around this thing.

847
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,580
Yeah, so I'd like to outsmart it.

848
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,940
What do you wanna do?

849
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,820
I just told you.

850
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,220
How will you outsmart it?

851
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,300
Describe it to me.

852
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:08,300
- Chess, chess, chess, chess, play chess.

853
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,800
- I'm gonna challenge it to a game of chess.

854
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,300
(laughing)

855
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,140
Yeah.

856
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,500
I challenge you, sir, to a game of wits.

857
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,860
- Hmm, intriguing.

858
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,020
(roaring)

859
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,620
That's a verbal yes.

860
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,060
- Okay, well.

861
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,900
- What the?

862
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,720
- A little cringe.

863
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,060
(laughing)

864
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,700
But I'll sit down.

865
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,540
- That's like what it says back, right?

866
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,380
- Yeah.

867
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,700
- You gonna play, is that what you're gonna do this turn?

868
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,540
- Watch this, I'm gonna trick it.

869
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:42,940
I'm already outsmart, I'm in the process

870
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,780
of outsmarting you right now.

871
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,600
- Okay, so it's the whole process.

872
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,020
- Does it accept my chess?

873
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:46,900
- No.

874
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,420
- Man, then I fucking shoot it in the head

875
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,540
with my perception. - You know what you should've done.

876
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,300
- Or no, sorry, my...

877
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:00,060
Oh, you know what I do?

878
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,100
- First of all, haven't seen this guy in a while.

879
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,460
First of all, I'm going to sneakily

880
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,900
let my huge worm that I have in my inventory,

881
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,220
I've had it in my inventory by the way for three campaigns.

882
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
- That's true.

883
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,780
- My huge pet worm that is always on my side.

884
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:20,380
I'm gonna let it out and slither down my leg, right?

885
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,340
And then have him slither behind him

886
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,920
and kind of sneak up on him.

887
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,060
'Cause I just want him to get one little bite.

888
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,860
but I'm distracting him with this whole stupid dance

889
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,120
of oh, I wanna play chess with you,

890
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,860
I wanna play chess with you, I'm crazy.

891
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,620
- The screech I did was stupid, this isn't stupid.

892
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,020
- No, the screech was amazing.

893
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,060
- Thanks, man.

894
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:44,060
- But I sent it my worm, and then right,

895
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,220
is he a little confused, the monster?

896
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,100
He's like maybe just weirded out?

897
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,380
- He's like completely intent on just killing you.

898
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,060
- Okay, well then, I'm going to,

899
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,700
then I'm gonna use this kind of SWAT team hand signaling

900
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,580
to my worm to be like, hold off.

901
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,180
- Worm understands everything.

902
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,020
- Of course, yeah, I know the worm very well.

903
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,860
We've done this for a long time.

904
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,700
- Yes, yes.

905
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:11,700
- I'm going to shoot my matrix beam at him right now.

906
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,140
- Okay, cool.

907
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,180
You can also send the worm around to do a worm thing.

908
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,540
- Well, the worm is going to, when he goes to attack,

909
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
the worm will bite him.

910
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,460
That's what I'm instructing with my hands.

911
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
- Cameron, show the camera.

912
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,300
- We'll figure that out.

913
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,060
- Battle camera. - I'm at a disadvantage maybe.

914
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,980
- While you're rolling that,

915
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,100
I just drew my second original meme.

916
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,300
- Oh, I got a five, I missed that, didn't I?

917
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,580
- Just show the camera real quick.

918
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
- What does it say?

919
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,700
- Oh, wait.

920
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,980
- It says, "Goes to party, stands in corner,

921
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,780
"and watches Vines," and it's a penguin on a rig.

922
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,540
- Socially awkward penguin. - Oh, 'cause it's the red.

923
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,020
No, the blue is the socially awkward,

924
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,260
that's socially, you made socially awesome penguin!

925
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,500
- Well, people like Vines. - Oh, true.

926
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,340
- Either way.

927
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:56,240
Anyway, I miss my blade, or my matrix beam, I gather.

928
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,320
- Yeah, you shoot at it, and it sort of just like,

929
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,760
kind of like, twirls its cards around in a way

930
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,040
where it kind of like dodges all the ones and zeros

931
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,140
that are coming at it.

932
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,860
- Asshole.

933
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,700
- Yeah, a bit.

934
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,460
And Patrick Yoda, it is now your turn,

935
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,840
but your worm is at the ready.

936
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,680
- Yeah, okay.

937
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,800
- The worm is like mouth open, like.

938
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,480
- Yeah, ready to eat.

939
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,680
- So.

940
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,960
Excuse you.

941
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
The fuck is that?

942
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Stop kissing it.

943
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Don't kiss the monster.

944
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,960
And I'm kissing the worm monster.

945
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,960
No, the worm is not the monster.

946
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
The worm is a friend.

947
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
Okay, then I am going to use...

948
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,960
You were the only one who actually had a pet.

949
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,960
I just remember Blotas, the monkey.

950
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
That didn't ever happen.

951
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,960
That just never happened, though.

952
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,960
That never happened.

953
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Now I have a pet.

954
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
You have a pet and he has a pet.

955
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
And it's a nanobot.

956
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I just don't have... I'm not responsible.

957
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm going to use Yoda's lightning.

958
00:34:48,960 --> 00:35:03,960
is

959
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,200
- It might do extra damage.

960
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,640
- Yeah, okay, then I will do that.

961
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,200
- So what does it say if Ryota's lightning?

962
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,200
- It ranges 60 feet and it costs four Technoslime points.

963
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,120
- And then what do you have to do to hit with it?

964
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,280
- I have to roll 4d8, no.

965
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,560
- That's for damage, what's the,

966
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,280
here go to your front sheet.

967
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,240
- Okay, my front sheet is on the front.

968
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,600
I have to do a spell attack for 2d6.

969
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,440
- Nice.

970
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,120
Wait, no, hold on, let me see your friend sheet, Pat.

971
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,080
- It says-- - No, I'm not remembering

972
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,000
correctly, it's been a while since you've done--

973
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,160
- Since you've used an ability.

974
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,600
- Pretty much.

975
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,400
Yeah, so it's a spell attack, so it's just d20 plus eight.

976
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,240
- Okay.

977
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,360
- And then you'll do 2d6-- - d20 plus eight.

978
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,600
- And then you'll do 4d8 damage.

979
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,760
- 17.

980
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,600
- Nice.

981
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
- Plus eight. - Yeah, that hits for sure.

982
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,920
- And then make sure you subtract four Techno Slime points.

983
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,600
It's not true, you know that.

984
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,000
I know you know that's not right.

985
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
- I don't know if that's right or not.

986
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,680
- He looked at me like, "Caleb, I did it, I did it."

987
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,500
- That's okay.

988
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,360
You can subtract four though.

989
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,560
- Wait, so my Techno Slime refills when I rest?

990
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,200
- When you rest or if you use one of your

991
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,960
Techno Slime refills, like pouches that you have.

992
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,800
- Yeah, okay.

993
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,700
- But right now you're gonna subtract from your total

994
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,920
and you're gonna now roll four,

995
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,020
actually wait, before you do that,

996
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,420
can I see your character sheet for a second?

997
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,140
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, your spells.

998
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,260
I wanna make sure that--

999
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,660
- Okay, Mr. Kleptomaniac.

1000
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,460
- We're using the right, that's not true.

1001
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,540
- Yeah, and I wanna see your phone

1002
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,660
and your keys in your wallet.

1003
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,700
I'm robbing you.

1004
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,540
- Do robbers take keys if they rob you?

1005
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,580
- Oh yes, there we go, yeah.

1006
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,420
- Yeah, and then they walk you to your house.

1007
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,500
- Yep, that's four, I'm sorry, I wanted to make sure.

1008
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,740
So it's four D8, right?

1009
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,980
- You're crazy.

1010
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,580
- So I roll four D8s?

1011
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,780
- Yes, so the D8s are-- - It's even weirder

1012
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,980
that it'd be cooler if you thought it was gonna happen.

1013
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,820
- Yeah. - Okay.

1014
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,540
Six.

1015
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,940
- Keep going.

1016
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,620
- Five. - Yeah.

1017
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,580
- Six. - Wow.

1018
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,140
- Three. - That's pretty good.

1019
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,780
So that is 20.

1020
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,860
It's 20 damage.

1021
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:18,460
So you shoot this thing up for 20 damage

1022
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,500
with your lightning.

1023
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,400
The lightning, as it creases through,

1024
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,220
you can start to actually see now what's in the chamber.

1025
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,000
and you see like creatures like lumbering like zombies,

1026
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,600
kind of like the zombies in Hyrule Town

1027
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,320
in Ocarina of Time. - I knew exactly

1028
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,160
which one you were talking about.

1029
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,120
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, those guys,

1030
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:34,960
like kind of lumbering around.

1031
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,800
- They look at you and they go.

1032
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,620
(screeching)

1033
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,160
- So they're slow zombies.

1034
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,080
- They're slow, but when they see the lightning--

1035
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,920
- None of this Last of Us fucking bullshit.

1036
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,760
- When they see the lightning--

1037
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,200
- 28 days later, not gonna happen.

1038
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,040
- They do start to like--

1039
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,880
- It's unrealistic.

1040
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,960
- They will start to move more quickly when they see,

1041
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,640
as the lightning creases through, lights up the area

1042
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,420
and you start to see both more of the alien architecture,

1043
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,080
you start to see more of those bulbs

1044
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,440
like you had seen in Huge Ass Facts' lair.

1045
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,360
- Hey guys, by the way, I've seen bulbs like that before.

1046
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,960
- But there's no yellow in them.

1047
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,840
Just say that as you're shooting lighting out of your hand.

1048
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,240
- There's no yellow in them?

1049
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,800
- Yes, in these ones.

1050
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,360
- So it's almost like Huge Ass Facts took these bulbs

1051
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,200
and ran normal electricity through them.

1052
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,240
- Oh my God, it's like those yellow bulbs

1053
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,280
right over on these here.

1054
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,920
- I was drawing with the actual marker on my screen.

1055
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,180
(laughing)

1056
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,520
- It's fine, it's no problem.

1057
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,760
- He's too faded.

1058
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,680
- Faded than a ho, faded than a ho.

1059
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,780
- Faded than a ho.

1060
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,200
- I didn't want to jinx you completely.

1061
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,400
- Faded than a ho, faded than a ho, faded than a ho.

1062
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,440
Okay, cool.

1063
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,840
Yeah, this thing takes some serious damage

1064
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,480
and then takes extra damage as well.

1065
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
- How much more extra damage?

1066
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,680
- When you set it in light on fire.

1067
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,180
Roll 2D4.

1068
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,360
Nope, you just rolled--

1069
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,200
- Snake eyes.

1070
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,460
(laughter)

1071
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,100
- He's rolled two D6s.

1072
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,600
- Patrick rolled two D6s, a two and a four.

1073
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,120
- Nope, these are still not D4s.

1074
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,620
That is the pyramids, they're the pyramids.

1075
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,880
(laughter)

1076
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,320
- That's funny every time.

1077
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,040
- 21.

1078
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,380
- No, it's a three.

1079
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:15,840
- Stop saying, stop saying.

1080
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,100
(laughter)

1081
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,940
- 21.

1082
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,500
Okay, cool. Yeah, I mean this thing is like is lurching back in pain. It's not looking too hot

1083
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:29,440
You are now. Oh wait. Can I do extra damage right now?

1084
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,140
You're flipping them off. He doesn't really register it, but he's probably upset

1085
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:40,020
Also as the light increases you see that the cards that are on it looks sort of like Yu-Gi-Oh or magic cards

1086
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,380
But oh my god Kingdom Hearts chains of memories, but the pictures are all of like pulsing like vaginas

1087
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:50,520
Just like like Georgia O'Keeffe postcards

1088
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:54,620
Because they're all

1089
00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:06,040
Probably nutted her fucking jeans when she saw that yeah, she never did a penis

1090
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:14,900
All of her pussy painting should have had in the corner a little discarded pair of jeans

1091
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,160
(laughing)

1092
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,380
- They should have had a little mini version of me

1093
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,160
sitting on him doing a peace sign going,

1094
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,740
(imitates gun firing)

1095
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,340
- You're up, Blotas.

1096
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,760
- I'm up. - Blotas.

1097
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,820
- It's dark in the cave?

1098
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,860
- No.

1099
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,700
- Yes.

1100
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,300
- Well, it was light a second ago.

1101
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,020
- 'Cause of the lightning, bro.

1102
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,780
Stop drawing.

1103
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,620
- It's 'cause of the lightning.

1104
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,140
- Well, okay, instead of yelling at me,

1105
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,580
will you maybe wait and hear my action?

1106
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,620
- Okay, I'm sorry for yelling and I'll wait.

1107
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:49,300
action I open my mouth I say "Hey who turned out the lights?"

1108
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:55,100
So it doesn't seem so stupid now to ask who it is.

1109
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,140
The thing hasn't gone yet?

1110
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,780
Hasn't had a turn yet?

1111
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,020
Okay then where's all my dice?

1112
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,060
I forgot to make Pat roll with disadvantage.

1113
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,900
I'll run up to it if I'm close enough.

1114
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,140
I'm just gonna hit it and I have advantage

1115
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,980
and if I hit it's a critical hit.

1116
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,940
- You have regular right now.

1117
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,860
- What?

1118
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,820
- You have regular 'cause you can't see none.

1119
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,440
So you go from advantage to regular.

1120
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,520
I forgot to make him roll disadvantage,

1121
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,300
but I'm-- - I have regular right now.

1122
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,700
I understand now.

1123
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,700
But I'm gonna do it.

1124
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:30,300
Do regular once.

1125
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,220
And that is a 13.

1126
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,060
- It's not enough.

1127
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,380
- Okay, and I'm gonna do a regular twice.

1128
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,500
- Wait, why come?

1129
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
- And that's a crit.

1130
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Oh my god!

1131
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
So basically I wasted my fucking 20

1132
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Oh my god

1133
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,500
Wait, wait, uh

1134
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,500
Oh yeah, because it hasn't gone yet

1135
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
Yeah

1136
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,500
21, oh

1137
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,500
*laughter*

1138
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Plus, that's 10, do I double the plus 4?

1139
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
No, it just counts

1140
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
You always do such chunky damage

1141
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
Yeah, he's sort of the DPS guy

1142
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
I'm the DPS guy

1143
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,840
- Don't say the penis sucker.

1144
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,100
- I was gonna say dude's penises per second.

1145
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,300
- That's too much, that's DPPS.

1146
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,140
- No it's not.

1147
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,500
- PPDS.

1148
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,260
- Sorry, are you adding your things

1149
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,540
or are you worrying about my language?

1150
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,380
- I already added it.

1151
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,200
- Okay, well then say it out loud.

1152
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,040
- You did 14 damage?

1153
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,880
- 14, I said it out loud.

1154
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,700
- Very nice.

1155
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:25,740
- Okay, well then just stop talking to me though.

1156
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,100
- So yeah, you run up and you miss and then--

1157
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,940
- Can we pause?

1158
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,300
- When you miss, you get your pause.

1159
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,340
- I have an issue I need to kind of figure out.

1160
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,480
- What's your issue?

1161
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,940
- I don't want to figure it out with you.

1162
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,440
Why?

1163
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Can we get in our private room?

1164
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,440
I think you take your headphones off.

1165
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
Yeah, you take your headphones off.

1166
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,440
And then talk. You have to whisper into my ear.

1167
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,440
He needs to go.

1168
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,940
What do you mean he needs to go? He's part of the campaign.

1169
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,940
He's out.

1170
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,940
No.

1171
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,440
He's out or I kill myself.

1172
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,440
I'd take him.

1173
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,940
Cam, come on. Don't do that.

1174
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
I'm gonna hang myself.

1175
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
What are you guys talking about?

1176
00:42:58,940 --> 00:42:59,940
Don't hang yourself.

1177
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,440
You're copying my move.

1178
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,940
Okay, great. Pat's out.

1179
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
- You're a copying flopper.

1180
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
- Matt and Caleb are out,

1181
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
or I shoot myself in the head on camera.

1182
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,000
- Okay, so then it's just gonna be me and you,

1183
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,300
what's that even gonna be?

1184
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,880
- My Dinner with Andre campaign.

1185
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,520
- Okay, I'm out or I kill myself.

1186
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,640
- That's fine, yeah, you can do it.

1187
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,040
- So you go up to this thing

1188
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,440
and you just bat it with your lead pipes

1189
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,960
and it takes another 14 damage.

1190
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,460
- Are we still doing that?

1191
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,300
- Excuse me?

1192
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,820
- Are we doing a My Dinner with Andre episode?

1193
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,760
- I'm open to it, we've talked about it.

1194
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,680
- Yeah, all right.

1195
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,300
And so then he takes damage and

1196
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:42,260
Yeah, I mean this thing is is not looking great, but it is still up

1197
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,640
So now it's its turn. I've said that before

1198
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,440
It's its turn now

1199
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,440
*laughter*

1200
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Hey baby, now it's it's turn

1201
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,440
*laughter*

1202
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,440
*laughter*

1203
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,440
*laughter*

1204
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,440
You had your go, now it's it's turn

1205
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,440
*laughter*

1206
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,440
*laughter*

1207
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,440
*laughter*

1208
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,440
*laughter*

1209
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,440
*laughter*

1210
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,440
*laughter*

1211
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,440
*laughter*

1212
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,440
*laughter*

1213
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,680
(laughing)

1214
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,020
- It's its turn.

1215
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,600
Oh my god.

1216
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,640
- Oh, it's its turn.

1217
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,120
Okay, he said it's its turn though.

1218
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,960
Sorry.

1219
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,380
- That's so funny.

1220
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,520
- Yeah, it's its turn.

1221
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,360
- Okay.

1222
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,880
All right.

1223
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,140
- So it attacks.

1224
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,900
Obviously it shoots fucking cards like gambit

1225
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,320
Out of its vagina holes that are in the pictures cards

1226
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,820
So all of you roll dexterity saving throws, okay? Oh my god. I

1227
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,000
Don't have a 20 piece

1228
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,160
23

1229
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,680
Okay

1230
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:11,040
I got a 12. All right. Just pick the good one out of these. I got a 9 I

1231
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:16,100
Got a nine that's gone. No bag of dice right there patches

1232
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,900
Oh, we've been missing we've missed lost a lot of dice wait on the bottom show then I should reroll with my own no

1233
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,940
Just if you're missing too many which might be the case camera might be missing too many

1234
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,860
I'm I can I get a new card sort of a full deck

1235
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:39,900
He doesn't even like those rolls

1236
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,240
Okay, and then what do you need pat d20?

1237
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,740

00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:55,060
Red oh my god, it's actually the one I wanted the ruby

1239
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:02,620
I rolled a 12 23. I get a 20 really liar. No he got a nine

1242
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:16,100
No, okay. I told you yes, why you guys are here together 28, so I'm at do I take half or seven?

1243
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,420

1244
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,660

1246
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:32,700
36 wait hold on open your phone. I did the calculator. Yeah, oh

1247
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,500
For what

1248
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:38,500
I did the calculator

1249
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,780
Calculator has been done. It's 13

1250
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:46,500
Not good at basic math man. We know I did this you know about it already. We don't have to keep bringing it up

1251
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:52,580
Yeah, I just wasn't expecting that oh

1252
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:59,660
Yes, oh instead so the

1253
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,860
- Oh wait, I don't get any sort of blocking power

1254
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:04,700
from having him on my chest?

1255
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,540
- You know what, you're right.

1256
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:06,900
- Man, fuck that.

1257
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,540
I get half damage too.

1258
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:10,100
- You do get half damage also.

1259
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,860
Sullivan takes the other half.

1260
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:14,060
- And my nanobot has a healing factor.

1261
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,400
- Sullivan is knocked out.

1262
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,020
Your nanobot does not have a healing factor.

1263
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,460
- Okay, then he gives me a pep talk.

1264
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,300
- So you guys can either--

1265
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,120
- A pep talk?

1266
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:21,960
- He gives me a pep talk.

1267
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,280
- Let me do a death saving throw for Sullivan.

1268
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,220
- Just one pep talk from Scooter though.

1269
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,660
- Okay, that's a failure.

1270
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,660
Okay.

1271
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,660
Dude, are we gonna do it again?

1272
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,660
Maybe. We're not killing him on purpose this time.

1273
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,660
You just strapped him to your chest and called him a bulletproof vest.

1274
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,660
As a cute nickname.

1275
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,660
I guess it's an upgrade from shirt. He was shirt for a while.

1276
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,660
Yeah, he was a shirt.

1277
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:50,660
He was shirt. Now he's gonna be put on a shirt.

1278
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,660
Yeah.

1279
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Either way, it is your turn, RayWilliamJohnson.

1280
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:56,660
Okay, I would like to...

1281
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,660
Eeweeweewee.

1282
00:47:58,660 --> 00:48:00,660
You've already done it.

1283
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,660
You've done your eeweeweewee.

1284
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,660
I would like to try my matrix beam one more time.

1285
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,660
Let's do it.

1286
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,660
Okay then, I'll do it.

1287
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:16,660
19.

1288
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,660
That's going to be a hit.

1289
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,660
I saw it quiver on the edge.

1290
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,660
Don't even say that, man.

1291
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:24,660
Moist.

1292
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:25,680
- Did I go there?

1293
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,100
- Stop, don't say that word, it's so yuck.

1294
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,900
- That's a one, I got a one.

1295
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,220
- Yeah, but you have more rolls.

1296
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,620
- Yeah, I don't remember how many I get though.

1297
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,640
- Try like three.

1298
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,020
- Yeah, try three.

1299
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,560
- Yeah, it's in the sheet for sure.

1300
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,060
- Oh my God, he said three,

1301
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,500
I said three and then he rolled a three.

1302
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,580
- And I was thinking two and he rolled two.

1303
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:46,420
- You have more.

1304
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,260
- How many do I have?

1305
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,580
- I think you have four.

1306
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:49,820
- Oh, you're right, okay.

1307
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:53,220
- Can I do a guest roll?

1308
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,780
- Oh wait, a celebrity roll?

1309
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,780
- Can I do a celebrity roll?

1310
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,420
- You can, but I don't get to add it.

1311
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,660
- Yeah.

1312
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,260
- But that would have been pretty decent.

1313
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,420
- Yeah.

1314
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:04,200
- This thing is looking very bad.

1315
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,380
- Yeah, you're telling me.

1316
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,460
- Yeah, it was looking so hot

1317
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,900
before we beat the shit out of it.

1318
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,740
- Yeah.

1319
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,780
- Patrick Yoda, you are up.

1320
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,340
- I am just gonna hit it with the damn hoagie.

1321
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,180
- Let's do it.

1322
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:20,580
- 14.

1323
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,500
- Plus.

1324
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,220
Just, just add it.

1325
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,820
No, you, just look at your attacks are in the top right.

1326
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,660
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1327
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,680
Sorry, top left for you.

1328
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,740
So that is 14 plus eight.

1329
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,840
Maybe, I don't know if it's--

1330
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,480
Hoagie surprise, plus eight.

1331
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,320
Is it really plus eight?

1332
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,160
It says plus eight.

1333
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,140
Oh yeah, I added it, it was--

1334
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,980
2D4 plus four.

1335
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,140
That's crazy I did that.

1336
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,680
Yeah, roll 2D4 plus four.

1337
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,120
Okay, that's a four.

1338
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,600
And that's another four.

1339
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,900
That's fine, I mean either way you would've killed it.

1340
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,840
Describe your kill.

1341
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:50,960
My kill is that, I mean it's a bunch of cards, right?

1342
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,960
Mm-hmm.

1343
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,160
I go to hit it with the hoagie and then I stop right before.

1344
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,680
And then I cocks its head and then I poke it.

1345
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,640
Oh no. And all the cards tumble down.

1346
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,640
Ed, what do you say?

1347
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,640
Finish him.

1348
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:08,960
I say, fuck you.

1349
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,000
No.

1350
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,280
Was this your card?

1351
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
No, you say.

1352
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
Was this your card?

1353
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,080
Okay, I walk up, I say, 53 card pickup.

1354
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,000
Nice.

1355
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,680
And I say at the same time, sir, 52 card pickup.

1356
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,800
Is this your card?

1357
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,120
Was these--

1358
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,680
Was these all your-- hold on, guys.

1359
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,040
Was this card all of your cards?

1360
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,340
I've heard of a house of cards, but this is ridiculous.

1361
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,240
Yeah, were these your cards?

1362
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,240
I know a thing or two about counting cards.

1363
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,000
And there's 52.

1364
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,400
Pick them up.

1365
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:36,900
Pick them up.

1366
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,400
Is that good?

1367
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,120
[LAUGHTER]

1368
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,720
You tied them all together.

1369
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,080
That was masterful.

1370
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,960
So we're going to keep doing death saving throws for Sullivan.

1371
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,440
We're just going to leave him there.

1372
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,440
OK, he succeeded.

1373
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,480
Keep walking.

1374
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,560
He succeeded.

1375
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,760
- Aw.

1376
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,440
- It's gonna be every six seconds, so.

1377
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,480
- But can't he just, if we already beat this guy,

1378
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,840
can't Pat just get him up?

1379
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,640
- Another success.

1380
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,080
- I'm just gonna wait it out.

1381
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,480
- We're just sitting there while he just gasps for air.

1382
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,840
- It's two and two, y'all.

1383
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,200
- Is Pat, you're not gonna help him?

1384
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,320
- No, what, fuck no.

1385
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,600
I got Scooter.

1386
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,480
- He lives.

1387
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,320
- Oh my god.

1388
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,160
- He has skin of his teeth.

1389
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,480
- I don't care about Sullivan, I got Scooter now.

1390
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,720
- He doesn't have teeth.

1391
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,760
- Yeah, but his skin of his gum, I know.

1392
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,000
- More skin, God willing.

1393
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:25,040
So he's just like passed out, barely alive, but pretty cool.

1394
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:25,600
OK.

1395
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,360
Back on my chest.

1396
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,680
You put him back on.

1397
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,320
You took him off while he was dying and just watched him.

1398
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,840
Yeah, we had to see if we needed to--

1399
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,200
We were all literally standing around him, watching him get

1400
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,700
close.

1401
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,200
[LAUGHTER]

1402
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,400
And then he goes, whoo!

1403
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,960
We're throwing down money like zero.

1404
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,840
[LAUGHTER]

1405
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,360
Cool.

1406
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:43,080
So you guys killed this monster.

1407
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,320
So you guys can-- so here's--

1408
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,320
Well, we killed the queen of the gloaches.

1409
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:47,880
That was not--

1410
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,380
Maybe.

1411
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,720
I'm going to leave.

1412
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,180
- Was that it?

1413
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,720
- It was not the queen of the cloches.

1414
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,340
- So you start to hear some stirring from down the hall.

1415
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,840
You might have made a little bit of commotion.

1416
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,440
- Oh yeah, we're in the kitchen.

1417
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,440
- You might have made a little bit of commotion.

1418
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,800
So you start to hear some stirring from down the hall.

1419
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,360
From the left you hear the same sounds

1420
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,200
you were hearing before,

1421
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,480
of the kind of like,

1422
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,920
like kind of cheering from far away.

1423
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,060
So it's up to you guys where you wanna go,

1424
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,960
but I will say that like the stirring you hear

1425
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,160
would suggest that something might be coming.

1426
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,500
- Should we walk towards that,

1427
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:20,340
or should we hide from it?

1428
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,180
- Let's get the heaves out of here.

1429
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,140
- Does it sound real, the stirring?

1430
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,600
- Does it sound like?

1431
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,580
- Wait, what do we know about the queen of the grotch?

1432
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,700
- The queen of the greech?

1433
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,540
- Yeah.

1434
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,640
- So yeah, let's pretend that

1435
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,900
Bear McGinnis finished what he said.

1436
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:38,900
So that she typically hides in her cocoon.

1437
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,300
- He was gonna tell us that?

1438
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:44,140
- Yeah, he was gonna tell us that.

1439
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:45,380
- So then let's go left, let's hide from this thing

1440
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:46,580
because this is not the queen.

1441
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,420
The queen's hiding somewhere.

1442
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,420
- That's not a cocoon.

1443
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:51,300
- Yeah, we want this thing to, I've played games before.

1444
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,220
- We're gonna stealth it.

1445
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:53,980
- We want this thing to walk past us

1446
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,280
and then we walk behind it,

1447
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,740
'cause it has something called a cone of vision.

1448
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,740
So I don't know if you guys have played

1449
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,160
many miniclip games, but there was one

1450
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,540
where you had to hide from the teacher,

1451
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:05,740
which I don't know, I never--

1452
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,580
- And there was one called--

1453
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,580
- Why are you hiding from the teacher?

1454
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,800
- Are you a grown man? - Are you a ten-pump BB gun?

1455
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,640
- What?

1456
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,760
- Joe Cartoon ten-pump BB gun.

1457
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,660
- There was-- - Another miniclip.

1458
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,420
- All sorts of games. - My friend just showed me

1459
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,400
game for Miniclip that we used to play. I forget what it's called.

1460
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,820
Yeah, my friend. E-Bomb.

1461
00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:22,100
No, no. I'm playing that.

1462
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,980
Etnies Downhill Jam.

1463
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,340
So yeah, I'm going to grab them and we're going to jump into the left,

1464
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,420
that little left turn, and we're going to wait for this fucking thing to go by.

1465
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,260
And I'm going to use my, can I, we like all hold our breaths and...

1466
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,500
Yeah, you can absolutely roll a stealth check.

1467
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,300
Okay, all right. I'm going to do that then.

1468
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,100
I can turn invisible.

1469
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:40,500
You can turn...

1470
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,580
Well, then do it, bitch.

1471
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,300
Oh, and then I can put on my arcade repairman outfit.

1472
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,100
I got to...

1473
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,020
I got an 11.

1474
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,460
Okay, go.

1475
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,460
Okay, I'm putting on the arcade repairman outfit

1476
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,060
and here's my stealth role.

1477
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,140
It's not gonna affect anything you do.

1478
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,220
I turn invisible.

1479
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,060
I got a six.

1480
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:57,940
Yeah, you turn invisible.

1481
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,220
You're invisible.

1482
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,340
You got a six, okay.

1483
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:03,500
And you guys, so yeah, move your characters down the hall.

1484
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,860
And I'm in an arcade repairman outfit, say that.

1485
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,180
So this is that left turn area?

1486
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,900
Patrick is in the arcade repairman outfit.

1487
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,860
Yeah, so he can be, oh.

1488
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:11,700
Wait, no, that makes no sense.

1489
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:13,500
I could walk around here and say

1490
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,420
that I need to fix the arcade in here.

1491
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,580
- So you hear like the stumbling of,

1492
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:22,060
not the monsters, but the Greeches themselves.

1493
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:24,700
- Can I ask a quick question about how

1494
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,220
Blowtoss's camouflage works?

1495
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,060
- Absolutely.

1496
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,260
- Is it how his invisible thing,

1497
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,060
is he fully invisible, you can see right through him?

1498
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:31,900
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1499
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:32,720
- Okay, gotcha.

1500
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,560
- It's not like super strong.

1501
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,740
- So we can't hide behind him.

1502
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,580
- No.

1503
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,420
- Okay, nevermind.

1504
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:38,820
- That's a good idea though.

1505
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,660
- Oh, I see what you're thinking.

1506
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,500
- You should try it.

1507
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,140
- You're not behind him, you're just standing

1508
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:44,820
out in the open going, "He he he."

1509
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,460
- Oh, I forgot about that, that's like a kind of,

1510
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,300
oh, that's cool.

1511
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,260
- Active camo.

1512
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,100
- Yeah.

1513
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,100
- One, two, ten.

1514
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,940
- Invisibility cloak.

1515
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,260
- Maybe that's an upgrade you can get, huh?

1516
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,100
- That'd be cool.

1517
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:55,920
- Huh?

1518
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,760
- Huh?

1519
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,900
- But instead, oh shit, there we go.

1520
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,740
- Talk into it.

1521
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,660
- There's my timer, sorry.

1522
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,260
So it's, you hear, it's some of the

1523
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,380
Greeches themselves are like,

1524
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,820
(guttural grunting)

1525
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,260
and they kinda like stumble through.

1526
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,100
- They just said, "What's up?"

1527
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:09,940
- And they're like, they have their--

1528
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,540
- What's up, what's up, what's up, what's up?

1529
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,100
- What's up, what's up, what's up?

1530
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,220
- They saw us, they're asking us what's up.

1531
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:20,220
- So these are like former workers in the space station

1532
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,740
who again were like corrupted by the poor air

1533
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,020
and water quality.

1534
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,620
And they've just been down here and they've just lost

1535
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,460
their mind. - And they had to move

1536
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,820
to the hood?

1537
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,620
- Not quite the hood.

1538
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,460
- Not quite the hood.

1539
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,700
- So you would live here?

1540
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,780
- What, no I wouldn't live there.

1541
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,780
- Okay, so you're saying it's just short of the hood.

1542
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,700
- What, no, it's not like any hood

1543
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:43,420
that you've ever seen before.

1544
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,660
It's the craziest, baddest hood in the world?

1545
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,160
Yeah.

1546
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:46,660
Damn.

1547
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,160
Oakland.

1548
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,660
It's not like any hood you've seen.

1549
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,780
Walking around the campus.

1550
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,900
This hood is not like any hood you've seen before.

1551
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:56,460
One of those YouTube videos where a Swedish guy

1552
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:58,260
walks around Oblok.

1553
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,900
This hood is not like any hood you've seen before.

1554
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,060
Just dark tunnels.

1555
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,820
[LAUGHTER]

1556
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:08,100
There's still a 7-Eleven.

1557
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,220
[LAUGHTER]

1558
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,020
But yeah, so they do see you guys

1559
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,940
because of Pat's clumsy stealth roll.

1560
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,860
And they kind of like,

1561
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,260
they all wander towards you guys crotch first.

1562
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:22,900
Are you flipping me off or the Greech?

1563
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,740
- Wait, hold on. - The Greech is

1564
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:24,820
'cause they saw me. - I'm going to,

1565
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:27,340
guys, we pretend to be them.

1566
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,660
- Oh my God, you're a genius.

1567
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,500
- Duh!

1568
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,460
Duh, I'm so stupid.

1569
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,580
- Roll persuasion.

1570
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,540
Roll performance, performance rather.

1571
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,980
- Let me see which one I have a better one of.

1572
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,060
They're tied. - Performance though.

1573
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:40,900
Performance. - They're tied.

1574
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,740
- Didn't count.

1575
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,460
- I saw what you got, don't worry.

1576
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,340
- A 20.

1577
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,300
- Okay.

1578
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,860
You are very convincingly just a greech right now.

1579
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,820
Just like stupid and like--

1580
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,660
- What's up, what's up?

1581
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,820
- Just trying to stick your dick in things to feel whole.

1582
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,560
You seem like an arcade repair man, Patrick.

1583
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,740
- Don't worry guys, I'll turn him.

1584
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:09,180
- Oh no, he's turning me and I'm an arcade repair man.

1585
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,140
- Why are you--

1586
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,700
- That's my bro, Rudy! - Drowning.

1587
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,820
- Okay, so do they believe me when I say

1588
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,460
I'm gonna turn him?

1589
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,300
- They go and attack him.

1590
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,380
- Bloody hell.

1591
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,140
- But here's the thing.

1592
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,520
Here's what I'll say about Greeches.

1593
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:27,140
These guys are kind of like fodder.

1594
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,720
- They're my dad?

1595
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,260
- They're gonna roll to attack.

1596
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:35,820
They're gonna roll to attack,

1597
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:37,180
but if you dispose of them--

1598
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:38,180
- That was good.

1599
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,480
If you dispose of them quietly,

1600
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,220
the monsters, who are actually pretty strong,

1601
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,980
won't come checking on them.

1602
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:47,260
- Okay, can I go--

1603
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:48,100
- So they're attacking you right now?

1604
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:49,140
- They're attacking you.

1605
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,540
- I grab it by the throat.

1606
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,060
- We want him to be quiet.

1607
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,980
- I grab it by the throat and I scream.

1608
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:55,820
- Shut up, bitch!

1609
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,660
- Don't scream!

1610
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:57,480
(laughing)

1611
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,320
- Can I?

1612
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,160
Can I?

1613
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,500
- You're gonna get me killed,

1614
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,060
I'm trying to do a stealth mission!

1615
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,260
- We're gonna roll initiative.

1616
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,820
- Trying to do a stealth mission!

1617
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,500
- We're gonna roll initiative to determine order,

1618
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,540
just me and you, Pat, right?

1619
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:09,540
Everybody here's my idea though. I have an idea

1620
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,740
Okay, yeah, you're trash

1621
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,980
I got a 15

1622
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:20,460
14

1623
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:27,940
You'll do something yeah, you roll too cuz you're a part of the like you could do there in this turn order so

1624
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,940
(gasps)

1625
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,100
(laughing)

1626
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,500
- You already looked like you knew

1627
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,800
you were gonna roll a one.

1628
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,900
(laughing)

1629
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,940
- You're like, okay, you really want me to roll?

1630
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:38,900
- Should I even do it?

1631
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,740
- Yeah, go ahead, man.

1632
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,100
- You really want me to roll, okay, cool.

1633
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:41,940
- That's what you get.

1634
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:42,780
- Yeah, you win.

1635
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,600
(laughing)

1636
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,700
- So they do go first, so they're gonna try to attack you.

1637
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:49,180
They're very bad, I mean, like, even with this,

1638
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:50,340
it's like minus their attack.

1639
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:51,700
'Cause they're going, (groans)

1640
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,100
like, kinda like, gumming, trying to gum you, almost.

1641
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:54,940
Like, (groans)

1642
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:56,220
- Yo! - I put my pants down,

1643
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:57,060
I let it happen.

1644
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:01,160
- Damn, wait, I never thought about wanting that before.

1645
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,360
- Damn, okay.

1646
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,800
Y'all seen Yes Man?

1647
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,180
(laughing)

1648
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:06,960
Why are you standing like this?

1649
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:07,800
- You never thought about wanting that before.

1650
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,880
- You're like, this is actual, I hate it.

1651
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,640
Can I, because they think I one of they,

1652
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:19,560
I'm one of them, can I kind of like let them walk by me?

1653
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,880
- You're walking all the way over there.

1654
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,200
You're far, far away from the microphone.

1655
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,360
Far, far, far and far.

1656
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:30,400
- Something's odd about you, we need to brush him to somewhere.

1657
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,200
Can I let them walk by me and then kind of one by one

1658
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,600
walk up to them, Agent 47.

1659
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,080
- Absolutely.

1660
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,920
- Break their necks.

1661
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:39,740
- Just roll, roll, roll.

1662
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,080
- Roll three D20s.

1663
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:41,920
- Huh?

1664
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:42,760
- Wait, no I listen to him.

1665
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:43,580
- Just roll one.

1666
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,420
- He's my boss.

1667
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,260
- What?

1668
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:46,080
- Just one.

1669
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,920
- Just roll one attack roll, yeah.

1670
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:47,760
- This one?

1671
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,580
- Yes sir.

1672
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:49,420
- Oh!

1673
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,260
- Oh, bet you wish you were all three now.

1674
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,000
- Bruv, you should have listened to me.

1675
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,840
- You rolled a one.

1676
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,680
- You should have just done it.

1677
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:54,500
- You rolled a one.

1678
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,340
- Oh man, you got a one.

1679
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,340
I do love that face. Oh shite.

1680
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,340
I have a picture of you making that face. I love that face.

1681
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:02,340
You should have just done what I said.

1682
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,340
Get that dragon.

1683
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,340
You go to snap their necks.

1684
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:10,340
I just snap my own neck and I die.

1685
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,340
No, instead you uh, snap it in such a way that it goes

1686
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:23,820
fucking shit I say hello to you hey everyone shut up shut up right now you

1687
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:31,580
hear you hear this thing lumbering lumbering down this hallway there is

1688
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:39,580
here on the left here on the left we all were ready on the left here there is

1689
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:46,020
Another passageway you could run down doing it. I'm running okay. I'm doing it fuck out of there

1690
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:51,500
It's passageway. I'm and you see a pit in front of you. I jump I jump in I jump in I jump

1691
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,300
I try to pull Sullivan's arm off like it's a parachute

1692
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,620
Okay

1693
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,800
We're all gonna take some damage now, so give me six

1694
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:09,140
Did you not do anything? I'm invisible. Are you just standing still yeah, fuck yeah, or at least walking slowly, okay?

1695
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,140
Can I roll to help myself?

1696
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:16,180
What does that mean can I roll maybe a cushion? I'll help him can I roll?

1697
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:24,920
Trampoline wouldn't that be acrobatics? I was gonna say you know it's a pit so roll acrobatics or athletics if you want

1698
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:32,420
18 okay very nice what I'm small enough to jump on his back no no

1699
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,660
We're just roll you're gonna mess up his y'all

1700
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:38,660
- Can I roll for Scooter to maybe have a trampoline mode?

1701
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:41,100
- It's a nano, why do you keep trying to give him stuff?

1702
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,100
- I want him to be like my little cheating pet.

1703
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,500
- He's ungrateful for his amount of abilities

1704
01:01:47,500 --> 01:01:48,340
and he wants more.

1705
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:49,580
- Damn, you have so many abilities.

1706
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,500
- It's a nine, it's a 10.

1707
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,340
- Okay.

1708
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:58,460
You take three damage.

1709
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,300
- Not a big deal to me.

1710
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:00,820
- You take six damage.

1711
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:03,060
What are you doing?

1712
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,060
- Honestly, I completely spaced out

1713
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:08,560
when I was getting scared how skinny my wrist is.

1714
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,260
And I don't know what's happening.

1715
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:12,740
- Okay.

1716
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:15,100
- So he rolled a one.

1717
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,420
- It doesn't look all that skinny to me.

1718
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:20,420
- It looks really small in the sleeve.

1719
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,020
- You just have a big sleeve.

1720
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:23,860
It's all--

1721
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,020
- Yeah, we all look the same.

1722
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,860
- Pretty much the same.

1723
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,260
- It looks really like a skinny wrist.

1724
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,260
- Yours looks big.

1725
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:30,460
- Yeah, yours looks normal.

1726
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,780
- Your sleeve is the right ratio.

1727
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,100
But yeah, I don't actually know what they did to take--

1728
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:34,940
- Oh, sorry, yeah.

1729
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:36,540
- We fell into the pit. - We jumped down a pit.

1730
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,820
- Yeah, okay. - Yeah, we jumped in a pit.

1731
01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:40,020
- You don't have to follow them.

1732
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:41,620
Nobody knows you're-- - No one knows you're there.

1733
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,340
- Yeah, you know what you could do

1734
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,700
is you could go to the prison

1735
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:48,740
and see if Sullivan is in there.

1736
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,940
- New Sullivan. - New Sullivan.

1737
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,500
- Okay, I'll do that.

1738
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,220
- So, the prison, I mean, like,

1739
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:57,100
you don't know exactly where the prison is.

1740
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,580
- Oh, but I drew a map.

1741
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,420
- That's right.

1742
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,340
- Of a different place. - We've established it.

1743
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:04,220
- Well, he can walk around.

1744
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,260
- Yeah, you can walk around.

1745
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:06,740
I mean, so how long is your visibility?

1746
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:07,580
Like a minute?

1747
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:08,400
- One minute.

1748
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,240
- Yeah.

1749
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,540
- Just run as fast as you can.

1750
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,380
- So it's been like 15, like 30 seconds, let's say.

1751
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:15,060
- So you wanna go back down this hallway, then.

1752
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:15,900
- I mean, I could just keep moving past it.

1753
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,900
- Once this thing uses it until, I have a few uses too.

1754
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,260
So, that's all.

1755
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,460
What else am I gonna use?

1756
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:22,300
My other abilities?

1757
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,120
I don't think so.

1758
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:24,120
- Yeah, I guess not.

1759
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:27,100
So, you two, though, fall down a pit.

1760
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,980
Into, you would recognize Ray William Johnson,

1761
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:36,160
Is sort of a toy pit like the one you saw earlier.

1762
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,960
- Like the one that we got pushed down earlier.

1763
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,720
- I'm scared for you guys now.

1764
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,320
- And the sort of cheering and yelping that you heard,

1765
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,680
it got louder as you like fell and when you landed,

1766
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,760
you saw it's the Greeches all sort of yelping

1767
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,920
and jumping around and like fucking shit

1768
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,480
and what they're fucking is the toys

1769
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,600
and also what they're fucking is a big ball

1770
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,280
of Greeches and toys all molded together

1771
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:02,840
like a katamari sort of thing.

1772
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:04,060
- I flip it off.

1773
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:04,900
- You flip it off?

1774
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,640
And it is this disgusting ball of flesh and toys

1775
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:13,160
and it turns to face you two.

1776
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:14,000
And we're gonna roll initiative.

1777
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:14,840
- What are you looking at?

1778
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,760
I turn the same direction.

1779
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,460
Look at it like this.

1780
01:04:18,460 --> 01:04:20,920
- We're gonna roll initiative for you two in a second.

1781
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,920
First, you, Blowtoss, what do you wanna do?

1782
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:23,760
What was that?

1783
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,840
Is that a five?

1784
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:26,680
- Nope.

1785
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,500
- It was.

1786
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,340
- It was a five, right?

1787
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,180
I saw that you said it.

1788
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,640
- I don't wanna keep it.

1789
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:31,480
- Minus one.

1790
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,800
- Let's not keep it.

1791
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:35,000
- I, wait no, plus one, that's six.

1792
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,320
- Six, it's a six, don't worry about it.

1793
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,760
- I guess I'm trying to go to the prison.

1794
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,800
- Yeah, sure, you certainly are.

1795
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,860
- As fast as I can without being caught.

1796
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:45,360
- So as you walk down the hallway,

1797
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,440
you see the monster that lumbered by.

1798
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,760
- I'm running, I'm making the most of my time.

1799
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,240
- It was this sort of like stretchy, fleshy thing

1800
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:57,280
that had like crackling electricity around it

1801
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,280
and it had reached Manus' hand in Dark Souls 1,

1802
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,480
reached for them and then lurched back.

1803
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:06,560
- For those who haven't played Dark Souls 1, like a hand.

1804
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,040
- Damn! - It's a specific

1805
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,520
looking thing and you know that,

1806
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:13,160
and yet you hurt me. - I'm getting it now.

1807
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,960
- And yet you hurt me and my feelings.

1808
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:17,000
(Justin laughing)

1809
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,360
It was for a friend, you betrayed me.

1810
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,080
So you go down the hallway like nothing.

1811
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,160
(Justin laughing)

1812
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,180
- And here, I'm gonna just redraw quickly.

1813
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,560
- Ooh, snazzy.

1814
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:33,560
- What the fuck?

1815
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:37,040
Bro, you on another level tonight.

1816
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,760
- I'm flippin' over the tiles, folks.

1817
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:41,200
- Should this one be flipped too?

1818
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,040
- Yes, it should.

1819
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:42,960
Let's just flip all of 'em.

1820
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,800
Fuck it.

1821
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,640
- Flip 'em.

1822
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,480
- Here, put 'em over here,

1823
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,920
'cause it's just a continuity sake.

1824
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,520
Continuity sake, kill me.

1825
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,360
Here we go.

1826
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,440
So-- - It's all green.

1827
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,640
- So again, it's not really totally to scale.

1828
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,520
I hate these greeches.

1829
01:05:58,520 --> 01:05:59,880
Me too.

1830
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:00,760
They're not great.

1831
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,400
They're making my life so difficult when I just want to reunite with my friends.

1832
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:07,080
Just making sure I'm drawing the map correctly.

1833
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,360
So you're really... Still I'm on a wild adventure.

1834
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,560
And now I gotta fuck this ball.

1835
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,560
Yeah, I have like no health. I'm at 5 HP. Are you sure this isn't exactly to scale?

1836
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,900
Stop it.

1837
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,520
Don't be mean to me.

1838
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,320
- Oh, you're drunk.

1839
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,160
Bottles are flying everywhere.

1840
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,680
- I'm not drunk.

1841
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,520
Stop it.

1842
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,340
- Fucking, look at this.

1843
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,840
You're gonna tell me that's not the drawings

1844
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,160
of a drunk maniac?

1845
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,000
(laughing)

1846
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,480
Look at this, show this.

1847
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,120
What the fuck is that?

1848
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:38,960
- Stop it.

1849
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,780
- Okay, I'll stop.

1850
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:40,620
- Stop it.

1851
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,360
No, it's fine.

1852
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:46,160
So yeah, you see a large chamber.

1853
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,880
- I jump into the pool.

1854
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:50,260
- It's not a pool, it's my fault.

1855
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,000
You see also a large, huge bed.

1856
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,800
It looks like fucking like 10 California Kings.

1857
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:56,640
- Ooh.

1858
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,080
- And it is just covered in filth.

1859
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,640
And greeches are like fucking on it

1860
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:05,640
and you see one monster also writhing around in the bed.

1861
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:07,200
- In the bed, like lying in it?

1862
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,820
- Yeah, while the greeches are like trying

1863
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,660
to latch themselves to it.

1864
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,640
The monster looks like kind of like part,

1865
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:15,480
also looks like part toy, part monster.

1866
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,960
- That is yucky vibes.

1867
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:17,800
That is yucky.

1868
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:22,320
- You see a stairwell on the left of the bed

1869
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:25,320
that leads towards the prison.

1870
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,160
- Okay.

1871
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:29,400
- It literally says, "Prison this way," on top of it.

1872
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,000
- I'm gonna run up the stairs if I can without my,

1873
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,440
well actually, how long do I have left of my invisibility?

1874
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,400
- You have like, let's see, I'm thinking about you

1875
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,880
running down the hall.

1876
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,600
You have like another 10 seconds.

1877
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,320
- Do you think that's a reasonable amount of time

1878
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,120
to get down this hallway?

1879
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,320
- It's a reasonable amount of time for you

1880
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,920
to round the corner to get to the stairwell.

1881
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,000
- Because if not, I'll just wait and I'll recast it.

1882
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,600
- I would probably wait and recast it

1883
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,440
- What else are you gonna do?

1884
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,260
- You're gonna run some risk.

1885
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,520
- I'm gonna do that then.

1886
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,360
- Okay, cool.

1887
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:56,960
- 'Cause I don't really wanna be caught while I'm alone

1888
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,620
'cause I'm scared when I'm alone.

1889
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:02,160
- For real?

1890
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,880
- What's so funny?

1891
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:06,960
- You're so tired you became the him.

1892
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:07,800
- What?

1893
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:08,640
I didn't do anything.

1894
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,400
He's drawing and laughing at it.

1895
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,720
- No, it's an old drawing from a couple episodes ago

1896
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,400
that I completely forgot about.

1897
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,240
- Let me see this one.

1898
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,400
- It's Cameron Spice.

1899
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,040
(laughing)

1900
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,400
- Cameron Spice.

1901
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,520
- I do like that one.

1902
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:21,820
- Yeah, that's a good one.

1903
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,900
I'm being strategic, by the way.

1904
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:25,740
- Yeah, sorry, just to avoid--

1905
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:27,220
- You just are talking funny.

1906
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:29,860
- So-- - I'm not talking that weird.

1907
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:30,980
- Weird.

1908
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,820
- He's not talking that weird.

1909
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:34,060
(laughing)

1910
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:37,620
All right, so yeah, yeah, you wait.

1911
01:08:37,620 --> 01:08:39,220
- Yeah, and then I go-- - Turn invisible again.

1912
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:40,980
Okay, cool, you go down to the prison.

1913
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:43,100
- Yeah, so, and then I think it may be one,

1914
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,140
maybe one Greech sees a guy just appear for like,

1915
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,180
one frame, and he's like, oh, oh, oh, okay.

1916
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:51,440
(laughing)

1917
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,500
- I have my pants around my ankles.

1918
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,760
(laughing)

1919
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:58,300
- So you keep going down,

1920
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,940
and so we'll go to you in a second.

1921
01:08:59,940 --> 01:09:00,780
- Okay.

1922
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:02,500
- And we're gonna go back to where you two are.

1923
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:04,180
- Thank God, I was getting bored as fuck.

1924
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:06,300
- I could tell, you started drawing.

1925
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:08,140
- I started tracing actually.

1926
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:08,980
- I'm sorry.

1927
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:10,500
- I'm not very talented at drawing.

1928
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,340
- Drawing.

1929
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:14,460
- I'm gonna start saying drawing like you.

1930
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:15,300
- Drawing.

1931
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:16,140
- Drawing, yeah.

1932
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:16,960
- Drawing.

1933
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:17,800
- And rum.

1934
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:24,280
So, where you guys are again is this pit with this Katamari-ass looking ball.

1935
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:26,280
I didn't want to be in here.

1936
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,280
I didn't want to be in here at all.

1937
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,280
You're saying that?

1938
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:31,280
Yeah.

1939
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,280
How loud?

1940
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,280
But I'm whispering it.

1941
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,280
It already knows we're here.

1942
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,480
I didn't want to be in here.

1943
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,000
So yeah, I mean we don't even have to draw this.

1944
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,640
I mean this is just going to be a big ball.

1945
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,120
Does it look like one of the guys from Doom?

1946
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,560
Oh, the Cacodemon?

1947
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,560
Yeah.

1948
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,560
Cacodemon.

1949
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,300
- Oh, it does sort of look like that,

1950
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,140
but it doesn't really have an eye.

1951
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:50,980
- Here it is. - It's really like

1952
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:51,800
just kind of a-- - I was thinking about

1953
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,600
the Elden Ring, but a big ball.

1954
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,160
- It kind of looks more like the, yeah, like the--

1955
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,440
- With the heads. - What are those?

1956
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,640
It's kind of like a lich.

1957
01:09:58,640 --> 01:09:59,480
It's like their version of a lich.

1958
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:00,760
- It's all those-- - It's like a failed--

1959
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,960
- Heads, stone heads. - Yes, yes.

1960
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:02,800
It looks like that.

1961
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,320
It looks kind of like--

1962
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,280
- That's good.

1963
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,960
- That's actually perfect. - It's like a tape roll.

1964
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,800
- Great idea.

1965
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,900
So you two, you rolled initiative.

1966
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:12,880
What did you get again?

1967
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:13,880
- A five.

1968
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,920
- Okay, which became a six, right?

1969
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,600
- No. - No, I rolled a six.

1970
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,800
- He became a six. - He got the six.

1971
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:21,120
- He got the six, oh Christ.

1972
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,760
- Plus one, motherfucker.

1973
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,520
- Okay, and then for the Katamari.

1974
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,080
Oh, okay.

1975
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,440
- Does it have a mouth?

1976
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,400
- No. - Shit.

1977
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,080
Does it have a hole anywhere?

1978
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:37,760
- I mean, it's a bunch of guys and toys stuck together.

1979
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,720
So there are crevices. - All right.

1980
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,520
- But nothing really.

1981
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,880
- I don't wanna know what that guy's gonna do with crevices.

1982
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,560
- So five, six, okay, and this thing got seven.

1983
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,800
So it is--

1984
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,400
- It's a dope-ass order.

1985
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,120
- Yeah, it is rolling towards you guys.

1986
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,960
So both of you roll dexterity saving throws.

1987
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,360
That's what this is, for sure.

1988
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,440
You got a one.

1989
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,280
- Motherfucker.

1990
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:03,300
- No, that's a seven.

1991
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:05,800
- You got a seven also?

1992
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:06,640
- Yeah.

1993
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,720
- No, it's a one, I was lying.

1994
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,240
- Add your dexterity saving throws.

1995
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,080
- Okay.

1996
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,240
- Well, not you, you're fucked.

1997
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,440
- I said six.

1998
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,440
I'm gonna die safely

1999
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:17,480
Yeah, well, it's I'm dead

2000
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:23,120
I'm dead. You don't know that yet. Don't give up. Hope yeah, you're dead

2001
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:30,600
And you you had 21 HP right 18 you have 18 yeah

2002
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,180
Cuz I took three damage from my fall. All right, you're okay

2003
01:11:34,180 --> 01:11:37,740
Just tell me bitch who HP now, okay?

2004
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:41,080
Don't trust him. He did the math for you

2005
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:46,520
Maybe I think I probably did die, but he's not letting me die

2006
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:50,560
Potion

2007
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,520
No, Scoot did scooter come with us or scooters in my

2008
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,680
Fucking pocket sorry house Sullivan doing

2009
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,200
Yeah

2010
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:04,080
He's still he's stable. Let's just say he's stable, and he's not gonna just

2011
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,760
Stabilized right well if you get hit if you get hit when you're like oh, there's a chance you

2012
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:17,300
Breaking the rules to keep this fucking loser alive, and we can kill him if you want. I don't want to do anything, but I mean

2013
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:21,320
Rules are rules

2014
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,800
Let's just move on I think it's a counts as another dead

2015
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,680
If he's stabilized or does it have to go negative HP. I actually don't remember

2016
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:31,480
Let me look this up. Okay. Let's find out

2017
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,480
Dead he's dead

2018
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:39,960
I wish I knew this offhand

2019
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:46,040
Yeah, being wounded so I think it's different for frogs. I think frogs instantly die when you look at them

2020
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,040
You kill your knock you out you gain one level of exhaustion

2021
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:55,000
This is why cuz it's all it's exhaustion crap, which I have exhaustion the exhaustion is like

2022
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:01,140
It's like each point like has like a debilitating effect until the last point you get is like death

2023
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:04,900
- What's next, fibromyalgia?

2024
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:05,740
- Yeah.

2025
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,140
- They're gonna add in?

2026
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,140
- What's next?

2027
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,780
- Yeah, they're putting exhaustion in.

2028
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:14,380
This game used to be about flesh wounds,

2029
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,740
cleaving limbs, and twain.

2030
01:13:16,740 --> 01:13:17,580
- And cleavage.

2031
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:18,400
- And cleavage.

2032
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,240
- For him.

2033
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:22,740
- Now it's about, what, they/thems?

2034
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:23,580
- Yeah.

2035
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,580
- Dressing androgynously?

2036
01:13:26,580 --> 01:13:28,080
Wearing chest binders?

2037
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,340
- I wear one of those, actually.

2038
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:32,220
So I wonder, so then does that mean

2039
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,780
do we restart the death saving throws?

2040
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,540
- That's what you're talking about.

2041
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,260
- What are you, get out of here, bro.

2042
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:39,100
What are you doing?

2043
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:39,940
It's not your episode.

2044
01:13:39,940 --> 01:13:43,220
- This is like mom coming down into the fucking man cave.

2045
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,580
Shut the fuck up.

2046
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:45,420
- I forgot to open it.

2047
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,540
- Ah, get away from me, mom.

2048
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:49,100
- I forgot you were there.

2049
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:49,940
- Freaked me out.

2050
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:50,780
I thought you were a goblin.

2051
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:53,780
I'm liable to shoot an arrow through your head.

2052
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:54,620
- If you're gonna talk,

2053
01:13:54,620 --> 01:13:57,180
you have to put your face really big on the blue screen.

2054
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:00,020
- I'm not gonna do that.

2055
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:01,680
- All right, whatever.

2056
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,140
Wouldn't that be kind of funny if you guys found out

2057
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,040
that I just wore a binder all the time?

2058
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,220
(laughing)

2059
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,060
Be kind of cool.

2060
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:07,880
- You had Guy Nicomastia?

2061
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:08,720
- I can't tell if it like--

2062
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:09,540
- I did when I was a kid.

2063
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,660
- I guess if it's stable--

2064
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,880
- I'll get into that another day.

2065
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,140
- I guess it restarts.

2066
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:18,340
I guess it restarts, so he takes another failure,

2067
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:19,300
is what that is.

2068
01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:20,140
- Okay.

2069
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:23,060
- That's what I'm just gonna play it as.

2070
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:26,100
- Somebody can DM me after.

2071
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,580
I never deal with this shit.

2072
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,140
- Now you can DM us and get off your fucking computer.

2073
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:31,340
- Get on with it.

2074
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,380
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2075
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,380
- And now for something completely different.

2076
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:36,500
- You're up, Ray.

2077
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,100
- Okay, I would like to throw, I would like to,

2078
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,380
I mean, I'm the only motherfucker alive in this bitch.

2079
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:44,660
I would like to throw a sexual grenade

2080
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:47,300
directly into one of the crackles.

2081
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:50,500
- They have sexual powers, I've learned.

2082
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,580
- It doesn't really matter because I'm just kind of,

2083
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,660
it's just an explosion.

2084
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,500
- Okay.

2085
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,320
- It's an explosion.

2086
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:59,400
- Roll and attack roll.

2087
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:05,200
Plus nine.

2088
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,080
- That does hit.

2089
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:07,200
- Nice.

2090
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,840
And then two D10s.

2091
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:09,680
- Two D10s?

2092
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:10,500
Oh dear.

2093
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,120
- Yeah, for the sexual grenade.

2094
01:15:12,120 --> 01:15:13,520
Which is this one I found out.

2095
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,360
- Yes.

2096
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,200
- Nice.

2097
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,020
- Ooh, it's an eight.

2098
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:18,120
- And this next one is.

2099
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:20,600
- Oh, a three.

2100
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,960
- Nice, and I think also, what is the,

2101
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:26,960
I always forget, what's the rule I have for fire?

2102
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,160
for extra damage is a rough--

2103
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:31,800
- For each additional two Technoslime points spent

2104
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,640
before throwing, Raywill and Johnson can deal

2105
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:35,080
an additional 2d10 fire damage.

2106
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,120
- Oh, well that's if you wanna spend more.

2107
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:40,320
I have like a Juicy ability.

2108
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,520
- Yeah, I'll do that.

2109
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:43,520
- So you'd spend two more Technoslime points.

2110
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,480
- Yeah, that's fine, so then I'll have one Technoslime point,

2111
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,440
but I have refills.

2112
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,280
- Nice.

2113
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,520
- So that's another 2d10. - So that's another 2d10.

2114
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:51,360
- That's fine.

2115
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:52,440
- Wow.

2116
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:54,000
- Well, I didn't know about it, asshole.

2117
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,880
- That's my fault, you're right.

2118
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,720
I should have told you--

2119
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,240
- Wow, shit. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2120
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,960
- Damn, okay, so what did you get then?

2121
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,040
- 28, no. - Wow.

2122
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,760
- Wait, is it 15 and then 18 and one?

2123
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:07,960
- You got 11 the first time.

2124
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:10,520
- Oh, okay, so 26. - Okay, well, that's very good.

2125
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:13,240
- I could be 100% wrong.

2126
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,080
- We'll just go with that.

2127
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:14,920
- Yeah, you just-- - We'll take a 26.

2128
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,120
- But then also, isn't there,

2129
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:16,960
I have something where it's like,

2130
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:19,840
you get sticky shit on it, I just wanna make sure.

2131
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,240
- Target must make a strength saving

2132
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:24,480
where the sticky cum reduces their movement

2133
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,720
by half for one round.

2134
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,920
It leaves explosive cum everywhere.

2135
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:29,760
- Okay, cool.

2136
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,880
(laughing)

2137
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,760
- Everywhere.

2138
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,600
- All right, cool.

2139
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,560
So it does succeed in the strength,

2140
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,040
so I guess it was to fling it off.

2141
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,400
I probably should change out the decks,

2142
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:38,360
but, or something else.

2143
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,900
But anyway, it does take 26 damage,

2144
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,920
which is pretty hefty.

2145
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:44,320
And you see it sort of like,

2146
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,340
like skitter away and like roll around,

2147
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,720
which you get an opportunity attack too as it does that.

2148
01:16:50,720 --> 01:16:52,320
- Please just fucking kill it in--

2149
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,880
- I--

2150
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,420
We should blow it into smithereens. It's just gonna be your dong blade. Wow it does hit okay

2151
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:02,720
That's gonna add you that but it is 1d 10 plus 5 mm-hmm

2152
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,660
Where my d2 others?

2153
01:17:05,660 --> 01:17:13,280
So that's seven shit, okay, that's okay. Yeah, so you slash it as it runs away, and it's like it's like

2154
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:20,760
Fucking it's fine, but it is like it skitters and like rolls away and kind of like stays docile for a second

2155
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,760
Can I stabilize Patrick while it does that?

2156
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,220
- Yeah, it is gonna skip its turn.

2157
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,320
- Okay, I'd like to stabilize Patrick.

2158
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:28,920
- So-- - Get my guy up and running.

2159
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,520
- All right, cool.

2160
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,840
So you can roll a medicine check.

2161
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,080
- I can't use my foreskin on myself, right?

2162
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:35,580
- No, you can't. - Roll a medicine.

2163
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:36,420
- Bro.

2164
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:39,640
- Nice. - 14.

2165
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,680
- That works, so he is stabilized.

2166
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,320
Roll perception as well, I wanna give you a little--

2167
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,520
- Dude, I'm basically rolling.

2168
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:49,080
- You're in a pretty dark place right now.

2169
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,120
- He has dark vision. - Holy shit.

2170
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,080
- He's the one who doesn't have supposed to have that.

2171
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,440
He can see everything.

2172
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,080
- No, you're in a dark place, I mean, in the game.

2173
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:58,600
Like you're in a bad place right now.

2174
01:17:58,600 --> 01:17:59,800
I'm giving you a little gimme.

2175
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:00,640
- Okay.

2176
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:01,480
- Like, but you rolled a natural one.

2177
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,280
- Well, he rolled a natty 28.

2178
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,960
- This thing is a Katamari.

2179
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:08,300
- That was it?

2180
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:09,840
Are you kidding me?

2181
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,680
No, he gets more than that.

2182
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:13,120
- Let me finish what I'm saying.

2183
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,060
You could roll it around.

2184
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,100
- Does it?

2185
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,720
- It is now stable.

2186
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,840
It's gonna start up again

2187
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,560
'cause you used your turn to stabilize Patrick.

2188
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:24,440
- Quick sidebar.

2189
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,480
- What is a catamaran?

2190
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,760
- You roll it around.

2191
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,960
- It rolls around, it picks up everything.

2192
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:32,800
- It picks up everything.

2193
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,620
- It's like a big ball of glue.

2194
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,560
- It's a ball of everything.

2195
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,240
- But can I drive it?

2196
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:37,320
- Yeah, you can push it.

2197
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,400
- If you push it.

2198
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,400
- Oh, you push it.

2199
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:41,880
But I can't get on top and run around.

2200
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:42,720
- Just push it, push it.

2201
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,540
- You could do that.

2202
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:44,380
- Just push it.

2203
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,220
- Can I get on top and run around

2204
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:47,440
and like basically do a reverse?

2205
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,280
- That is the exact--

2206
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:49,600
- Like I move my feet forward

2207
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,520
and it goes forward like in Mario Party?

2208
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:52,580
- It's exactly like Katamari.

2209
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:53,700
- Like bumper balls?

2210
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,540
- Yeah.

2211
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:59,200
- That would be an athletics or acrobatics check.

2212
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:00,160
- Well, I'm not gonna risk it.

2213
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,800
I'm just gonna get behind that thing,

2214
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:02,640
hit it from the back.

2215
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,640
- So right now, what you've noticed,

2216
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,880
I mean, you got 20.

2217
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:07,440
- So.

2218
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,320
- What you've noticed is that it stops

2219
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,240
and like sort of stands still,

2220
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:14,160
and then you used your turn to get up Patrick,

2221
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,680
and it kind of starts up again.

2222
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,520
Stop, don't do that.

2223
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,520
- Okay. - Stop that.

2224
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:22,240
So it's going to come back at you again.

2225
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,480
But maybe if you hit it, it will stabilize again.

2226
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,680
You see what I'm saying?

2227
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,880
But first, you're gonna have to roll

2228
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:30,400
dexterity saving throw.

2229
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,440
- Okay. - And you might die.

2230
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,640
- Yeah, right.

2231
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,140
I only have a negative one.

2232
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,560
- Holy shit.

2233
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,600
- I should've left my hand there

2234
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,680
and let it bounce off my hand.

2235
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,000
- Guys, it's over.

2236
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,280
Show them. - We're all gonna die.

2237
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,600
- Show them.

2238
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,440
- You gotta create one, right?

2239
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:45,880
- It was a 16.

2240
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:46,840
- No, it was a one.

2241
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:47,680
- Okay.

2242
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:48,520
- Slank.

2243
01:19:48,520 --> 01:19:50,020
- Yeah, I mean, you're--

2244
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:50,860
- It was an 18.

2245
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:52,180
- It was actually technically a zero,

2246
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,500
'cause of the negative one dexterity.

2247
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,900
- Yeah, I mean, you're dead.

2248
01:19:55,900 --> 01:19:57,620
Like, you're knocked out.

2249
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:58,460
- Bro.

2250
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,780
- You're stable here.

2251
01:19:59,780 --> 01:20:01,780
- And I don't know any of this is happening.

2252
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:02,620
- Mm-hmm.

2253
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,380
- We're fucked.

2254
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,940
Wait, wait, I have, oh my God.

2255
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:06,780
- I'm running around invisible--

2256
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:09,380
- Oh my God, it's Scooter's time to shine.

2257
01:20:09,380 --> 01:20:10,420
(laughing)

2258
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:11,740
- It is Scooter's time to shine.

2259
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,580
- Holy shit. - Does he control Scooter now?

2260
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:14,420
- No, but Scooter--

2261
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,240
- Ratchet and Clank?

2262
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:16,080
- Scooter can run that. - Scooter can--

2263
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:16,900
- Oh, I'm dead.

2264
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:19,700
- Gouter can see this is happening.

2265
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,540
- And let him know.

2266
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,380
- And try to run up and get out of the hole.

2267
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:25,020
- Can he just use my PSP?

2268
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,340
- He can tap into my PSP.

2269
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:27,180
- He could use your PSP.

2270
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,700
- He could become my PSP like Rotom.

2271
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,180
- He could, well he could just use it.

2272
01:20:31,180 --> 01:20:32,500
- In Pokemon Galaxy.

2273
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,540
- He goes to your PSP and he types.

2274
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,700
- Okay, I can't even have that.

2275
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,780
- He is saving your life.

2276
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:41,300
This nanobot, you made your friend.

2277
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:42,620
- We don't know if he's saving our lives yet.

2278
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:43,780
- Well, we'll see.

2279
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:44,900
- 'Cause we have to start riding.

2280
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:46,580
- Oh yeah, you do have to start rolling death throws.

2281
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:47,080
Yeah.

2282
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:47,580
Yeah.

2283
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,580
So, not you. You're fine. You're stabilized.

2284
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:51,580
Oh, I got a 19.

2285
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,580
You're stabilized. There's no issue for you.

2286
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,580
He's the one who might die.

2287
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:56,580
Twelve.

2288
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,580
Okay, we'll stop right now.

2289
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,580
He's typing T...

2290
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,580
Do I have service, guys?

2291
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:02,580
You have service.

2292
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:03,580
I don't know.

2293
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:06,580
The whole thing, it's a big 5G station.

2294
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,580
I was at a stairwell. I went down.

2295
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,580
Blotoss, help, help, help.

2296
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,580
New friend's dead.

2297
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,580
Is my... Well, wait. I can't see my PSP. It's invisible.

2298
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:19,580
- I'm fine with it. - Roll another death saving throw.

2299
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:20,400
- Okay.

2300
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:21,620
(dice clatter)

2301
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,460
10.

2302
01:21:22,460 --> 01:21:23,700
- All right, that's two successes.

2303
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,060
- Oh, not so funny now, asshole.

2304
01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:28,340
- You receive the message.

2305
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:30,060
- Is my PSP invisible?

2306
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:30,900
- I'm rolling another one.

2307
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:32,300
I'm rolling another one right now.

2308
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:34,800
So my clothes are visible then.

2309
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,380
Three, three successes.

2310
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,740
- Stabilized.

2311
01:21:37,740 --> 01:21:38,560
- What does that mean?

2312
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,460
How long can we just stay stabilized?

2313
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:41,300
- Forever.

2314
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,180
(laughing)

2315
01:21:42,180 --> 01:21:43,020
- Really?

2316
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:43,840
I kinda wanted to die.

2317
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:44,680
I was kinda like--

2318
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,580
- I don't know what the technical rule is for that.

2319
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:47,580
I mean this thing--

2320
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:51,140
- We finally go into our first actual mission

2321
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,140
to not all die.

2322
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:55,880
- This thing is gonna like charge at you again.

2323
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,720
- So we'll have to--

2324
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,220
- Okay, so I can get the message.

2325
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,620
I feel the vibration.

2326
01:21:59,620 --> 01:22:01,820
And--

2327
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,560
(mimics gunfire)

2328
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,400
- Pick up your mic.

2329
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,500
- What did you say the rule was?

2330
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,180
If I'm already stabilized and he attacks me,

2331
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:12,300
I have one more saving throw to see if I stay stabilized

2332
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,080
or if I go back into death throes, right?

2333
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,980
- Yeah, which reminds me that Sullivan is also,

2334
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:17,580
you guys might all just die.

2335
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:18,940
- I'm coming, I'm on my way.

2336
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:19,980
I felt the vibration.

2337
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:20,820
- I don't know.

2338
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,660
- You're one minute away.

2339
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:22,940
- You're like one minute away.

2340
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:26,940
- Yeah, well then he'll decloak in the pit.

2341
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,680
- Yeah, we're gonna do it where it starts again.

2342
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,520
I think I like that.

2343
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:33,180
So let me roll the two, the others for Sullivan.

2344
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,020
- I can't teleport anymore, right?

2345
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:34,860
- That's a success.

2346
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:35,680
- Success.

2347
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,520
- That's not a success.

2348
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,340
- Oh, I can teleport.

2349
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:40,700
- Sullivan is stabilized by some fucking--

2350
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,540
- Okay, so what do we do now?

2351
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,900
- You two are both destabilized.

2352
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:46,660
You're one minute running towards them.

2353
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:48,180
- How long does it take me to run that distance?

2354
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:49,340
- 18.

2355
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:50,300
- Okay.

2356
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:51,140
- That's a fail.

2357
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:51,980
- Okay.

2358
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:54,140
- 10.

2359
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,620
- Okay, success. - That's a success.

2360
01:22:56,620 --> 01:22:57,780
- Roll again.

2361
01:22:57,780 --> 01:22:59,460
- That's a success, two successes, one fail.

2362
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,620
- You're stabilized.

2363
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:02,840
- Stabilized again.

2364
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,660
- Both are stabilized again.

2365
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,860
- Great success.

2366
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:05,700
- Wow, that's pretty lucky.

2367
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,580
- I'm running in slow motion.

2368
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,560
- You're running in slow motion.

2369
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,000
You get to the pit.

2370
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,140
I teleport down I jump down I'm belly flop

2371
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:19,320
Five damage

2372
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,980
Five damage I can hold that what's your what's your?

2373
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:26,640
31 what the fuck I didn't take

2374
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:33,560
All right, and you two are now a part of the Katamari am I oh

2375
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:38,200
Unconscious do we have to do another one visible mm-hmm or ward off weird?

2376
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,840
- No, you two are stabilized right now,

2377
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,320
unless he's gonna attack him again,

2378
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,360
which will cause you guys to--

2379
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:45,200
- Destabilize you.

2380
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:47,120
- And he will have to hit it.

2381
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:48,560
- I run up and hit it.

2382
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,200
Let's not stop beating around the bush.

2383
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,920
- All right, roll damage.

2384
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,400
- Damn, oh, okay.

2385
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:56,040
- Well, I'm sorry, stop, stop, you tricked me.

2386
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,040
- I tricked you.

2387
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:57,880
- You tricked me.

2388
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,240
- Nat 20.

2389
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,080
- No way.

2390
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:01,920
- Yeah.

2391
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:05,120
- So everything's solved.

2392
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,720
- Pretty much, he's gonna kill him.

2393
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,440
- Well, you guys are gonna be destabilized again, though, too.

2394
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:10,800
- Oh, from that?

2395
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,960
But he would have three turns, right?

2396
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,840
12 damage.

2397
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,920
- Okay, that thing now stands still.

2398
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:23,760
And so, you two, yes, you have three rounds.

2399
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,240
Just take your failures, don't keep rolling,

2400
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:26,080
don't keep rolling, don't keep rolling.

2401
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,900
- One fail.

2402
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:27,740
- Don't keep rolling yet.

2403
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,840
One success for Sullivan.

2404
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,680
Don't keep rolling.

2405
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:31,800
One fail, one fail, one success.

2406
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:32,920
Now it's your turn.

2407
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:34,480
- What am I supposed to do?

2408
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,560
- Yeah, what is this?

2409
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:36,880
- What is this situation?

2410
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,840
- You could try to peel them off the ball.

2411
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,860
- They're on the ball, I peel you off the ball,

2412
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:42,460
and I also push the ball.

2413
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:47,320
Is there like a hole with spikes at the bottom?

2414
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:49,800
Or a big hydraulic press?

2415
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,340
- Do you start pushing the ball?

2416
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,160
- Yeah, but I wanna push it somewhere away.

2417
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:54,500
- You control the ball now.

2418
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:56,480
- Okay, so then I command the ball,

2419
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:58,520
I say, "Get my friends off of you!"

2420
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:01,360
- Well, I mean, you control it like you can push it.

2421
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,400
- Put his back on it.

2422
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:05,480
- And as you push it, you add more bodies and toys to it.

2423
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,180
- No, they're getting covered up.

2424
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:09,760
- No, no, you peeled them off, right?

2425
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:10,680
- Yeah, I already peeled off.

2426
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,480
- I didn't, you didn't tell me I already could do it yet.

2427
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,120
- Okay. - I failed again.

2428
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:15,960
- Okay.

2429
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:19,320
- Nice success.

2430
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,160
- Sullivan fails.

2431
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:21,600
- So that's three successes.

2432
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,440
- No, you had two successes.

2433
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:23,260
- No, you had two successes.

2434
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,100
- And I have two fails.

2435
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:24,940
- Stop rolling. - Stop rolling.

2436
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:26,640
- You're supposed to roll one per round.

2437
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:27,480
- I saw that, don't roll yet.

2438
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,960
So, you can now roll up and it can pick up more bodies.

2439
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,600
- But I don't wanna do that.

2440
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:33,440
- You don't wanna do that.

2441
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:36,440
I wanna save my friends, I don't know what to do.

2442
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:39,520
- So do you have any healing abilities?

2443
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,320
What can you do for healing?

2444
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,060
- I have nothing, I have no healing abilities.

2445
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:46,740
I have nothing.

2446
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:48,760
- That's just gonna happen right in front of you.

2447
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:51,600
- I could kill, I could put them in mind prison.

2448
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:57,360
- To keep me forever alive in your heart?

2449
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,380
- I'm a video of them having sex.

2450
01:25:59,380 --> 01:26:01,560
- That might shock me awake, like smelling salt.

2451
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,400
- I have use object.

2452
01:26:03,400 --> 01:26:04,400
- Don't you dare.

2453
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,600
(laughing)

2454
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,180
Don't you dare use me.

2455
01:26:07,180 --> 01:26:09,640
- Okay, I'll try to stabilize them.

2456
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,320
Is that medicine check?

2457
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,960
- Yeah, you can do one at a time.

2458
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,240
- Who are you doing first?

2459
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:16,320
- Who has more failures right now?

2460
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,160
- He does.

2461
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:17,980
- Okay, I'm okay with this.

2462
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,360
- I wanna die.

2463
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,080
- That is a 15.

2464
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:22,920
- Sorry.

2465
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,120
- Oh, fuck you.

2466
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,320
- Okay, all right.

2467
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:29,760
That's two failures or one failure?

2468
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,600
Do you want two failures?

2469
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:33,960
I think it's do or I don't know that was one failure for you, okay, all right

2470
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,080
Sullivan has two successes one failure all right now. I will do a medicine on Pat

2471
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:44,360
That's a 17 Wow okay now the big one and now I push the ball away

2472
01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:50,180
Stabilized I didn't even notice all right you push the ball away the ball is still

2473
01:26:50,180 --> 01:26:54,360
Now you're just in this pit. I don't have any heal it. What do I do?

2474
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:58,160
- We need to move our bodies around?

2475
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:00,680
- Yeah, you gotta add us to the ball, bro.

2476
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,880
That's the only way to get us around.

2477
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,520
- Here's an action I have in my actions list, help.

2478
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,400
- You could help, I use help.

2479
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,560
- I use help. - With action?

2480
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,960
- That doesn't make any sense.

2481
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,360
- He could help me by getting the foreskin out.

2482
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,200
- Yeah, can he pull his foreskin over me?

2483
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,960
- Yeah, can I pull his foreskin open?

2484
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,800
- You can pull his foreskin.

2485
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,680
- That I like, there was another solution,

2486
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,240
but I like that solution.

2487
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,080
- Well, what was your solution?

2488
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,280
- What was, no, no, no, no, no.

2489
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,120
- Say it, I'm not gonna do it, but just need to know.

2490
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,640
- Let's just do it, let's just do it.

2491
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:27,400
- Roll the ball to pick up enough guys

2492
01:27:27,400 --> 01:27:29,240
that you can climb and get out.

2493
01:27:29,240 --> 01:27:31,200
- How's that help heal us?

2494
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:32,020
- Well then heal us first.

2495
01:27:32,020 --> 01:27:33,200
- We can't heal you right now.

2496
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:34,800
That's nothing you can do about that.

2497
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,640
- Oh, okay.

2498
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,240
I roll the ball around so it gets big enough to climb.

2499
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:41,200
- No, no, no, I like the foreskin idea though.

2500
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:42,280
- Okay, I do that.

2501
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,760
- All right, it's gonna do half heal.

2502
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:44,720
Let's do that. - That's all right.

2503
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,560
That's fine with me.

2504
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:48,320
- So roll, you roll the heal. - But then I can do,

2505
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,160
but then everything gets-- - What do I roll to heal?

2506
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,100
- The ball gets put in motion, if you pardon the pun.

2507
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,120
- Get the ball rolling.

2508
01:27:55,120 --> 01:27:59,920
- Okay, that is for 1d10 plus four.

2509
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,160
- So we'll do this and then--

2510
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:03,200
- Eight.

2511
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:04,440
- And then divide that by two.

2512
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,620
- Well, eight plus four.

2513
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:07,460
- Each of us get what?

2514
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:09,560
- Oh, 12, so then each of you get six HP.

2515
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,400
- Nice.

2516
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:11,720
- And Sullivan, too.

2517
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,560
- Nice.

2518
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:15,460
- And now you guys are in this pit.

2519
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,240
- Okay, we're all rolling the ball together.

2520
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,560
- I roll the ball over them.

2521
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,240
- And you roll the ball over the bodies

2522
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,600
to make it big enough so you can climb out of the hole.

2523
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,600
And next time...

2524
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
It was a puzzle.

2525
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,600
We will continue...

2526
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,600
Through the future's lair.

2527
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:28,600
Oh my god, it was a puzzle.

2528
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:29,600
That's why we almost died, because it wasn't a fight.

2529
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:30,600
No, that wasn't even a D10 that I rolled, that was fine.

2530
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,600
Wow.

2531
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:32,600
That was a fun little...

2532
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,600
Was it fun?

2533
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:34,600
I like, I like the whole point of D&D is being this close to dying every single time and

2534
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:35,600
then being like, just kidding.

2535
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:36,600
That was really close, you guys got some very good rolls.

2536
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:37,600
That was, yeah.

2537
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,600
I, you know, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I

2538
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,080
That was a D10 that I was fine. All right, that's a fun

2539
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:44,120
I like oh

2540
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:50,560
I like the the whole point of D&D is being this close to dying every single time and then being like that was really close you

2541
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,640
Guys got some very good. That was yeah, I

2542
01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:55,400
Bye

2543
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:19,000
