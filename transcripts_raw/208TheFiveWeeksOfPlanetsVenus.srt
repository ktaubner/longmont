00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
*outro music*

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,040
(thunder)

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,600
- Dead in the middle of little skibbity skibby

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,280
did we know that we skibbity

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,800
- Skibby did we know we riddled some camera men

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
who didn't do skibbity.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,680
- Who didn't do skibbity.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,640
- It'll be a cold day in toilet the way I,

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,280
the day I take in a loilet.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,560
- Take a loilet.

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,000
- Skibbity skibbity skibbity.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,400
- Make no mistake for.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,240
- Boil it.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,480
- For boil it I won't, I wouldn't hesitate to toilet.

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,680
- Just an idea.

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,360
- That's a good, that's a good idea.

17
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,160
Can someone one of you three explain to me or you to not this guy, somebody

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,600
explain to me why I ate chicken Marsala for breakfast at nine thirty in the

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,040
morning. I asked I did the same thing. No fucking way. Fuck yeah. I did the same

20
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,280
when we recorded the first day of planets. Maybe this is maybe this is a

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,800
plus a planetary sign, but I the stars are left over. I had the stars are

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,200
literally aligning for the five weeks of planets. I'm not even kidding. I have a

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,880
story to tell today. My God, shit is shit is getting fucking weird out there. I'm

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,840
not kidding for breakfast for breakfast on the first day of planets. Mine's

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,200
worse. I had leftover marsala and garlic bread. Mine's so much worse man. Well,

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
it was at eleven ish around nine thirty and I didn't have leftovers man. I woke

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,880
up and I made chicken marsala at nine thirty in the morning. Damn. That was

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,720
just what was in my fridge. I was like, oh, I have all the ingredients for

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,300
chicken Marsala and I ate it and I immediately fell asleep.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,120
Do I cut up the chicken? Yeah. And it's cubes. It was like...

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,840
You wanna hear something fucked up? Yes, I do. Okay, so this is

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,600
my dad's... My dad cuts it up into cubes, right? And you know how you're

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,800
supposed to get a little bit of prosciutto or pancetta, put it in the

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,000
pan. Yeah. My dad, when we were growing up,

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,840
I think it was just a broke boy thing, my father put cubes of

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,720
regular ass ham in the masala. He did that so, he didn't even put parsley in it or I don't

37
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,880
remember if he did or not.

38
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,000
I mean I wasn't doing all that much crazy shit anyway.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,840
Replacing the prosciutto with ham was so insane.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,760
Yeah, that's like cubed ham.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,760
Cubed turkey or like Oscar Mayer ham.

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,480
Yeah, pretty fucked up. Pretty fucked up for you to do, dad.

43
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,040
Yeah, that definitely put him out of it.

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,920
Now when I make it, I always use pancetta.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,240
Do you think you've been affected by nitrites because you had so many growing up?

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,720
I've been affected by nitrites as well.

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,440
I think that every single one of us has.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,520
I'm starting to think that the reason I have diarrhea right now is because of the tap water

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
in my house.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Maybe.

51
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,040
I think I might have evil tap water because I drink it all day.

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,160
I think it's because I drink only out of plastic and eat out of plastic only.

53
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
And you reuse Gatorade.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
I eat plastic on everything.

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,720
And you read plastic books too.

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Yeah, the Kindle, man, that shit's made of plastic too.

57
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,480
I basically touch as much and eat as much and smell as much plastic as I can on a daily

58
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
basis.

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
You can't avoid it. You can't avoid literally the only way. I'm sorry to

60
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,720
jump into this too early. Maybe the only way is literally to leave planet

61
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,420
Earth. Yeah. Holy shit, guys. Welcome to Venus. This is the second and third.

62
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,900
Well, technically, the third episode. Welcome to week one of the five weeks of

63
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,240
planets week one day to week one day to one out of five two day week today. I

64
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,020
mean, what were you saying? You were saying something about the stars aligning.

65
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,140
I need to hear what I'll get to. I'll get to it. I'm sorry if you five weeks

66
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,900
I talk about really been well. No, I want it after we do do all of our Venus

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,100
intro stuff. I'll tell this if you couldn't tell we're dressed up like

68
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,520
Venus today, although we had some some amount of disagreement, I guess over

69
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,540
what color Venus is. That's okay. I got both going on. You do have both, but

70
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,700
what's the black about? Well, we'll go down. You want me to start with my with

71
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,040
my costume? Yeah, I'm just up as a line. No,

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,680
I'm just up as be any if I walked out on the street right now, any person who

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,120
was literally who attended at first grade would know I'm dressed as it would be

74
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,020
some people

75
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,480
Coraline. No first grader would look at me and say that's Venus. No, they would

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,040
a child who was into science and into movies who would have seen movies. Why

77
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,080
did you say movies and of course they'd say Coraline man? Well,

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,480
if it was movies around Halloween time, if they saw me in a costume like this,

79
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,040
they would say Venus. They would say that's Coraline. She's very pretty today.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,760
No, they wouldn't say that they would say I like Coraline's mustache jumping

81
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,880
off of pretty here. Venus is actually the name of the God is Venus is named after

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,740
the goddess of beauty and of love. So I elected to put on a beautiful wig today

83
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,140
and a

84
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,160
my beautiful hair camera. Now you're asking about the yellow raincoat. So let

85
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,920
me explain this to you. Venus, the color can be some people say it's yellow. Some

86
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,660
people say yellowish white. Some people say beige. This raincoat is yellow,

87
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,820
definitely too yellow for Venus. Some people at this table would say beige. I

88
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,400
I think two people would do, but say beige Venus has it's surrounded by

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,880
sulfuric clouds. It has a sulfurous atmosphere, which is why it's that

90
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,420
color and in the upper atmosphere constantly acid rain.

91
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:13,760
Wow, wait, so I'm dressed up like coral layers of rain, so that's the

92
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,480
yellow. It's the yellow acid rain and then I have a yellowish white shirt

93
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,720
here

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,120
to this is kind of closer to the color. I feel a little bit like coral

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,060
lame and then dude chill. I'm just as Venus. I don't know why you guys are

96
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,920
stuck on this. I don't look anything like Coraline. You pull up. I said

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,440
Coraline. It's going to look completely different from what I'm wearing right

98
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,500
now or a lame, though. Yeah, he said that's not then that you said nonsense

99
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,320
word and you're proud of that. You're proud of making up a word.

100
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:47,860
That's you man. That's I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't try to

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,260
dress up like this. No, wait, no, she has blue hair. I literally did not

102
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,000
think about this in advance and try to dress up like this, guys.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,960
It looks exactly-- you do the Coraline cover.

104
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,200
Anyway, I'm wearing-- I got beige pants on, too, to cover the beige.

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,160
You have striped leggings. I can see them from here.

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,480
Uh-huh. I'm completely beige right now.

107
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,720
You're completely beige. Yeah.

108
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,600
So you went for basically only color and didn't really think about the science?

109
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,320
I'm wearing a pair of pants. No, I did not think about the science.

110
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,880
It's just a difference of like--

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,200
It's a difference of style and how people do costumes.

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,360
You may be the most scientifically accurate dude, but honestly bro, you look like a herb.

113
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
I don't.

114
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
You look like a herb.

115
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,680
Guys, guys, uh uh.

116
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
You know what it is?

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
You're getting...

118
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Why are you roasting me so hard like the hot atmosphere on Venus?

119
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,680
You're roasting him because you guys, he's dressed up too much like Venus and you're

120
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,120
in your head, you're thinking of Venus, right?

121
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Yeah.

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,480
And you're thinking about the OJ the Alien song Venusian Destroyer.

123
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,480
What's Venusian Destroyer?

124
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
I haven't heard that.

125
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480

Well, well, well, Venus. It looks like we meet again.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Don't think that I forgot about you, 'cause you're about to enter a galaxy of pain.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Fat Venus, Fat Venus, Fat Venus, we hate that shit.

This is a diss-diss-style?

You know me, I'm from planet Glarion

And I'm addicted to citrus

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fuck Venus

You shouldn't have tried that shit with me.

Didn't you know I'm a fucking crazy motherfucking psycho alien?

154
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,660
And guess what?

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Whoa, dude.

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
In part two.

158
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
What?

159
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Let me continue.

160
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,960
That's right.

161
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,460
Part two.

162
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,440
Oh my God. Okay, wait. So now this is bringing the lore to a place where I

163
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,580
can understand it. His name is OJ and he only eats citrus. He's from planet

164
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,860
glarion. He's from planet glarion. He only eats citrus. What is a marcino

165
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,100
cephalian? Marcino, what is it? Margino cephalian means it's kind of like a

166
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,420
dinosaur that's got like,

167
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:38,540
like three, like a triceratops, you know? It's got like a... He's a dinosaur now?

168
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,000
he's got like a dinosaur like face because he's got skin like he's a

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,500
reptilian. Oh,

170
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,400
it's a reptile alien. Well,

171
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,880
cephalos head right, so yeah, Margino is that small? I think it's small head. I

172
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,000
don't know. Marjoram, I butter head, butter head,

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,400
maybe he's a butter head on his, it's like a Amish slur. Yeah,

174
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,300
maybe on

175
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,980
She's a butter head, which is like, it's like, yeah, you know, oh man, OJ the alien

176
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,380
looks so good, butter head.

177
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Yeah, yeah.

178
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Oh, shit.

179
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,900
Butter head, the head that he gives is bad.

180
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,100
I do it gives a bad head.

181
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,940
I did explain butter face to my 25 year old wife the other day.

182
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,340
She did, she didn't, she had heard it and thought that it meant that somebody had a

183
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,740
face that looked like melted butter.

184
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,440
That's reasonable to think.

185
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,220
But I, I explained it's way meaner than that.

186
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,220
It is.

187
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
It's way meaner.

188
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,320
here. Yeah, well yeah, I guess yeah, but still it's a it's a backhanded

189
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,060
compliment. It is definitely a compliment. I agree more of a comment

190
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:48,160
than your face looks like melted butter. Yeah, that's what I try to explain to

191
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,640
her. She's a

192
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,360
your body looks like shit.

193
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:58,720
That's a butter face could mean yeah. All right, I have a new so every every

194
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,560
week every day of the week. We're going to get a new every day of the week.

195
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,300
no, it's a two day week, a planetary week. We're doing five two day weeks.

196
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,080
Thank you for saying that, man. A lot of people don't realize that people need

197
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,460
to learn about the planetary weeks that are going on. Learn today, man. We're

198
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,880
gonna get a new OJ the alien drop and I've also decided that I'm gonna start

199
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,420
doing, 'cause I realize last time when we did Mercury, which tune in if you

200
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,220
haven't heard the Mercury episode, tap the fuck in. What the fuck you even doing

201
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,080
here? Turn this shit off. Go back to Mercury and come back here, bitch. I

202
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,480
felt, I tried to read some Mercury facts and I felt like I was a little

203
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,020
disorganized and the facts weren't so interesting. So I decided to do some

204
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,700
research and I'm well, no I'm doing every planet from now on I'm going to do

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,160
write a planet report. Wow, I'm going to research it and write a report with the

206
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,680
most important. Do you have a theme song? I actually do have some music to play

207
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,300
while I'm on my bed, so well, it's not a thing you can still do a theme. So

208
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,740
mine is just kind of background music

209
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:53,540
I'll add a theme song. That's a really good idea. Yeah, I'll do that next next

210
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,940
time. Okay, this one is a planet report. This one is called with Coraline

211
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,520
guys. I'm not Coraline. Sorry, I didn't mean to say it. So I'm going to take my

212
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,020
costume off. If you keep talking about it, don't take it off, dude, Coraline is

213
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,760
too young to strip naked. Yeah,

214
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,840
don't do that.

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:13,140
Okay, I'm going to start my report now.

216
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,960
Visions of Venus, a planet report by Cameron Fetter,

217
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:25,040
of all the planets I've done research on so far, Venus is the one I've done the

218
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,700
research on. In the process of writing this report I've honestly started to feel

219
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,540
very loving and possessive toward Venus. I feel like this wonderful planet belongs

220
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:39,820
to me. I've started calling it my planet. Just one of the many magical feelings I

221
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,420
felt during the five weeks of planets. Now, on to the facts. If you've been out

222
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,220
and about at night you've probably seen my Venus before. My Venus is very easy to

223
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,260
to spot with the naked eye. Just look in the sky for something yellowish white. Yes, my

224
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,940
Venus is yellowish white in color. My Venus is named after the Roman goddess of beauty

225
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:08,060
and sex. My Venus is sometimes also known as the morning star or Lucifer, which are

226
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,380
both names for the devil. My Venus was the first planet to ever be discovered. My Venus

227
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,980
is the second brightest object in the night sky besides the moon. The reason for this

228
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:26,060
is the clouds of sulfuric acid that surround my Venus. A day is longer than a year on my

229
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:34,020
Venus. My Venus is very hot. The hottest one. My Venus is even hotter than Mercury, even

230
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,640
though my Venus is further from the sun. My Venus is around the same size as Earth, which

231
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,380
leads it to sometimes be called Earth's twin. But it's rather small compared to some of

232
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,300
the other planets of our solar system.

233
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,100
you should say my son as well. Yeah, my son, yeah, it's further away from my

234
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,500
Venus.

235
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,760
Yeah,

236
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:58,460
for example, you could fit about four of my Venus's into Uranus and still have

237
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,460
some room left over

238
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:07,260
the four of my Venus's and Uranus would be rotating clockwise because my Venus

239
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,340
rotates clockwise.

240
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,620
That's my report on Venus.

241
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
That was an amazing report.

242
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
It rotates clockwise.

243
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
That was an amazing report.

244
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,940
I'm really impressed by your planetary knowledge.

245
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,940
Thank you.

246
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
I did a lot of research for that one.

247
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,820
I'm glad that you are bringing knowledge and facts to the planetary report.

248
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,620
I'm glad that I can bring music and Caleb, I want to know what you're bringing.

249
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,620
Yeah, what are you bringing?

250
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,820
Because me and Cameron have stuff.

251
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,980
Well guys, as we said yesterday when we were eating Mexican food, I felt left out because

252
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:47,020
because you were making amazing rap and Cameron was basically being

253
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,260
scholastically studious and I realized that I had nothing

254
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,980
until

255
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,060
a spark of inspiration hit me and I realized that I'm an amazing artist and

256
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,300
here is my rendition of the planet Venus, guys. Wow. Oh my God. Can you zoom

257
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,180
in on this, Julio? This is incredible. Wow, I'm seeing a yellowish... Can you

258
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,220
describe this yeah blurry yellowish planet, a yellow, a bit blurry planet

259
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,120
and I put the space is like kind of behind its stars, dotting the entire

260
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,900
galaxy. I really am happy with how this turned out. I think it's pretty good.

261
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:27,900
Who is this? Who is this? I'm seeing a woman kneeling yeah up. Oh that's yeah

262
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,860
that's Amanda.

263
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,500
Okay, who's that? She's just like on there. She looks good. I guess yeah.

264
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,160
that is I mean speaking of butterfaces wait, that's wrong with their face.

265
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,260
That's the only part I painted.

266
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,960
That's the only part you painted.

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,360
Because I use a what do you mean by that? I use it.

268
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,360
They're not what I traced over on my app on wait. Let me see what the app is

269
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,760
called. Hold on. I got a painting app. I think I'm getting really into painting

270
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
recently. Yeah, I wish you had the go-pro.

271
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,060
It's really good. The painting is called Ibis paint X.

272
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,460
I've been saying that app is called Ibis paint X and it has different girls that

273
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,740
you can trace. Oh, and so I traced this girl, but she basically had an egg head.

274
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,660
So I added lips and a nose and some eyes and some hair. Yeah, I can see the hair,

275
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,460
but that's a man.

276
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,420
Two big strands of hair in the front of

277
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,700
on Wikipedia or something. It said that there was an,

278
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,940
an Amanda on. Okay. So I just basically,

279
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,180
can I see the reference photo that you used for this? Yeah, I can show you.

280
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:35,880
Hold on. I just want to see. I got to make a new on Ibis paint. Hold on. I got to make

281
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,860
a new photo guys. Okay. Hold on. And now I got see you go over here and then you go like

282
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,940
wait, where did I more of the this is less about V. Yes, you can do. Okay. Tracing sketches

283
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,980
apps and I try to get one with a lot more feet in it, but they didn't have any. You

284
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,180
can do different like I could have done this one. Oh, you just try it. So it's a trace.

285
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,740
Maybe I'll do this one next time. That one's not so bad. It's like two guys sitting on

286
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,080
on each other's butts. Yeah, it's pretty impressive. Well, I really like your

287
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:08,820
do you have a title for your Venus painting Venus or no sorry Amanda.

288
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,860
Okay, yeah,

289
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,320
but I'm pretty. I never thought I'd see Amanda sitting on my Venus. Yeah, and so

290
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,200
this is basically I'm going to be doing a painting of every single one and then I

291
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,300
think maybe and now I might even go back and do Mercury. Oh, that's a good idea.

292
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:28,640
That's not a bad at maybe then I was thinking maybe we could do like a like a

293
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,640
book a book like with the report and like a table, but a coffee table book.

294
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,280
Okay, here it's a coffee table book. It's got the paintings, it's got the

295
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,720
reports and then you know, like a birthday card that when you open it, it

296
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
plays music wow between every few pages. It's got a different song.

297
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,020
We'll find we can find out a way to do that. That's actually that was an

298
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,640
amazing, amazing idea because it could have on the left side. It would have

299
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,200
the report yeah on the right side. We'd have the pain and then it would play

300
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440
you're hearing it all and it's ten pages.

301
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,080
well ten, it's twenty twenty pages of really thick, but you know what it

302
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,640
could be a birthday card thing yeah. You know what it could be is one of those

303
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,000
old

304
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,600
those books that have like the buttons on the side. Oh yeah, I used to have

305
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,480
there's ten, but that's also sway ten buttons there. So there goes

306
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,040
mercury yeah like that kind of thing yeah yeah wow that's an amazing idea or

307
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,200
it could be you open up on one of the pages. It has grooves like a record and

308
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,180
can put the boy to a table. Yes, it's like a man. Oh my God. I remember books

309
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,000
like that. Yeah, we all had books like that growing up. So record book. I

310
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,260
want a record book in a raffle as a kid.

311
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,680
What really? Yeah, it's a real thing. I was making a joke. I know that's a

312
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,140
real thing. What can't be true? Look it up, look it up, look up, use the

313
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,560
pages of a book as a fucking record. Now, the cover is like vinyl and then

314
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,400
search a vinyl book record book is just gonna be a record. Yeah, it's gonna

315
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,640
be

316
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
vinyl record book.

317
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Vinyl record book?

318
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
This can't be real, man.

319
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
And it's like it would...

320
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
I remember books that you could take in the bath.

321
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
It was like a...

322
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Okay, you're not getting anywhere with this search.

323
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
Yeah, you're a bad Googler, man.

324
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Yeah.

325
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Okay, there we go.

326
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,640
I still think it doesn't exist, man.

327
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
No, it exists.

328
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
I believe you.

329
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
I'm willing to just believe you here because I don't think we're going to find a good picture

330
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
of one.

331
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Okay, that's fine.

332
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,640
That's fine.

333
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,640
Yeah, I think that some kind of...

334
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
I don't know.

335
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
I think that some kind of...

336
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
I don't know.

337
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
I think that some kind of...

338
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I don't know.

339
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,640
I think that some kind of...

340
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,600
I think we're going to find a good picture of one. Okay, that's fine.

341
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,280
That's fine. Yeah, I think that some kind of or a calendar we could do a

342
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,200
calendar at nine

343
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,760
a ten month calendar. We can add two more. We can we can for it's exclusive

344
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,320
for just the calendar. That's actually a genius idea earth and the rings of

345
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,560
Saturn. Yeah, the asteroid belt, maybe earth could be Christmas.

346
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,520
I actually just remember another Venus fact that I didn't put in my report.

347
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,620
This is another Venus fact. Venus is the only planet that we've discovered so

348
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,820
far with a fly trap.

349
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,460
True could be more out there, but that's the only one we know of right now said

350
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,580
that man Venus fly trap is from my hometown. Yeah, I have I have I've roots

351
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,540
in Venus literally literally roots literally the roots of a Venus fly trap

352
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,300
while from one week to Venus flies. That's where that's where it's like from

353
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,260
completely. It's yeah, it's only there like a fifty mile radius that this is

354
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,660
that that plant is in yeah, wow naturally they say yeah, which there's

355
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,000
nothing natural by outer space. Well, that's actually it's that why it's

356
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,500
called a Venus fly trap, because I think that it came from a different planet.

357
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,640
Yeah, I think so. Well, that's what happens in a little shop of horrors. I

358
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,680
couldn't find the real shit I was talking about. All I could find was the

359
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,600
simply read album, so I think that this is an un Google thing, but it's that

360
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:38,180
a for the vinyl record. It's very bad SEO, but my first grade teacher, Mrs

361
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,580
Iosu, I got a book from her that she said I don't have a record player

362
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,680
anymore, but I'll just read the book to you guys. Why the hell didn't he just

363
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:51,040
fucking kill a bunch of dogs and feed it to the plant in that movie? That's not a

364
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,920
bad point. I think I wanted humans, but it doesn't know that I think it likes

365
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,800
you. It does. It did. He didn't give him any. No, no, he fed. It's a big point of

366
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,360
the yeah, yeah, yeah, he feeds on. It gets a taste for human blood, so just

367
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,820
that's why like dogs. Oh yeah, he could have said that it was a dog. He could

368
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,480
have said I'm a dog. I'm a dog. I need your human blood. He could have been

369
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,000
like

370
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,820
the original one. Now the it's it's not so good, but it's the one really funny

371
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,160
part is

372
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,340
the one before the Rick Moranis one. Yeah,

373
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,980
yeah, Jack Nicholson is in it. The old Roger Corwin from the sixties is it a

374
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,180
singular a singular a musical? No, it's supposed to be funny, but it's not very

375
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,500
funny, but one very funny part is there's a character who Dick Miller plays

376
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,300
a character who just is always in the flower shop and his thing is just he

377
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,600
just likes to eat flowers. That's funny. It's so funny. He just comes in and he's

378
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,120
like I'll get like a dozen roses and they're like and they're like oh it's

379
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,880
for your wife. Maybe he starts eating them and it doesn't a bunch of times

380
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,680
dick. Miller sounds like a frat house prank yeah.

381
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:56,080
It really does that you would pull on somebody now yeah in the old dick

382
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Miller yeah or Miller Dick, the five weeks of planets is taking over the

383
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,280
world. Yeah, people have been talking about it. This is a crazy. Can I tell

384
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,000
you something I this morning when I got my haircut? Oh yeah, wait, not this

385
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,540
haircut, but the one on the city,

386
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:14,480
the barber he was talking to me the entire time and I didn't bring this up.

387
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,420
He was the one who introduced this topic. You can be kidding. We were

388
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,560
talking the entire time about the annihilation of planet Earth. Oh, by

389
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
what all types of factors from outer space, Jesus from outer space, not

390
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,260
where you get your right solar flares the same place that Joe went. Is it in

391
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:36,180
Bushwick? No, it's right on it's right on myrtle species, but yeah, I didn't

392
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,680
bring it up. He just started talking about it and we were I was having a

393
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,760
ball talking to him about

394
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,400
the

395
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,560
barbers, and it was there was a guy getting his hair cut next to me, who

396
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,040
was like he was like a

397
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,160
sanitation worker guy, kind of a gruff sanitation worker guy, and

398
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,040
Barbara was talking about

399
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,040
about how the Earth's magnetic field switch. He also was talking about global

400
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,680
warming is fake, but he was talking about how Earth's magnetic field is it

401
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,420
switches every hundred thousand years. It switches poles that's true and he was

402
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,020
like yeah and who knows how it could affect any it is true, but he's like who

403
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,540
knows how could it could affect stuff like it's going to mess with our

404
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,460
electronics and this and the guy sitting next to was like yeah and it could move

405
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,220
everything and then the guy said it will move every

406
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,500
and they both just agreed with each other that it's going to move. I'm going

407
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,180
to move every day. Yeah, it will move everything, for example, fishes,

408
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,860
fishes will move. Do they have a date for the polar shift? I think it's

409
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:35,280
happening right now. Well, that's what he said. He said we're going through it

410
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,660
right. Oh my God, I've been feeling like something has been shifting. He also

411
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,500
said that Russia is trying to figure out how to make a yellowstone erupt to

412
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,780
destroy the United States. I could that destroy like good chunks of the earth

413
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,680
like a whole planet. I think half of America, yeah, have a mirror, but also

414
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,640
it might even crawl up to that old, but it's I mean the real problem is

415
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,520
volcanic ash that blocks the sun. That's the trouble. I mean the whole I would

416
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,220
I think that's one of the troubles.

417
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,220
The other trouble is the...

418
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
Well, that's the trouble for the planet.

419
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,220
Oh, yeah.

420
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,220
Well, but also, they don't get...

421
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,820
I mean, Hollywood gets destroyed, so good luck getting your movies.

422
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,820
We truly...

423
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,480
I think I was talking about this last night.

424
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,580
We truly have the whole market cornered on movies.

425
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,020
It's not a very insightful thing to say.

426
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
Earth does?

427
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,020
No.

428
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,020
That's true.

429
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,020
America, USA.

430
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,580
Well, no, they make movies into every country, bro.

431
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,420
Yeah, but have you ever seen a movie from...

432
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,620
RRR dude. RRR was amazing. Every Japanese movie is all incredible. Every Japanese movie bro.

433
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,020
Types of deep intellectual words. I think I was talking to Alex. This guy doesn't like

434
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,220
stalker. No, you know what I think I was talking about? I was talking to Alex last night. Pusher

435
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,780
1, Pusher 2, Pusher 3. I was talking to Alex last night about that fucking. Looper. Looper,

436
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,620
jumper. That Israeli SNL show. Frogger. Oh the Israeli SNL show. Yeah, I was just saying

437
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,420
that they are so bad at comedy in Israel.

438
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
Hmm.

439
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,420
I don't know if I'd go that far.

440
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:59,580
I actually think some of it's funny, man.

441
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,580
I said I was...

442
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,580
A lot of my friends are actually on that show now.

443
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,580
Okay, you know what?

444
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,580
I'll...

445
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,260
I said it already, but I'll admit it.

446
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,980
I was pretty drunk and I said...

447
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:15,460
I think I said that, "Don't come for my Jews, but these Israelis are not funny."

448
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,460
Damn.

449
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,700
You said, "Don't come for my Jews."

450
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
I said I fuck with my Jews heavy.

451
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I said I fuck with my Jews heavy, but these Israelis are not good at comedy.

452
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,700
You said I'm starting my Israeli boycott tomorrow, guys.

453
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,700
That's right. No more weather for me. That's what you said.

454
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
I didn't say that, but you did.

455
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
That's right. I'm done with the weather.

456
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,700
I'm not enjoying any kinds of weather anymore.

457
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Due to my Israel boycott.

458
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
That's part of BDS.

459
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Yeah, and I said, "Dude, you can't say that shit, man."

460
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
I don't know why you even brought that up.

461
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,100
shut up. I think that it's the hangover speaking,

462
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:55,040
speaking of hangovers, back to the movies, back to the movies. We should

463
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,900
make barbership. That was a that's oh yeah, that is a good idea. So

464
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,420
barbershop, barbershop, exploitation, but it's alien. So plane on soul ship,

465
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,220
soul ship, holy shit,

466
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,420
how's it all playing on a space station in that is incredible barbership

467
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,620
barbership

468
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:16,520
that would be such a good movie

469
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,140
bro. That would be such a this is less about the movie and more about just a

470
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,780
spaceship. That is a barber shop, okay, you can imagine their tractor beam when

471
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,700
they're beaming stuff up. It would look like the barber pole. It would yeah

472
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,260
so many amazing ideas. The alien comes up and he has like kind of twill, like

473
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,140
kind of head and they and the guy like

474
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:43,180
that's not my hair yeah or they cut it and he's bleeding everywhere dies and

475
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,260
sprays blood and the bloods green and the guys like an ice cubes like bro. What

476
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,640
the hell was I supposed to cut plasma cube? That wasn't your hair man and this

477
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,520
could be a space station next to Venus.

478
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,040
I mean I yeah it could be anything.

479
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:01,220
I'm just trying to keep it on theme with the jumps around most likely yeah,

480
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,660
we'll get back to Venus. We'll get we'll get back. We'll get back to me. Don't

481
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,320
for now. We're on the barbership. I wish I wish man and then you got a white

482
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,780
alien walks in and a records.

483
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,620
Oh yeah,

484
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,280
what's up man?

485
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:20,360
Yeah, I'd like to get a just a little bit off the sides and the top leave the

486
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,360
top pretty long. Okay,

487
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,660
they give him the craziest haircut of all time and he becomes cool and afro

488
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,740
yeah. They give him an alien. So this

489
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:37,580
going around it or burning is afro. Yeah, he swagger's. Yeah, it could be a

490
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,220
teaching moment, though it could be he walks in wearing a shirt that says back

491
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:46,820
the blue gags, a shirt, a shirt that says that's a blue backs, a shirt, a shirt,

492
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,980
back the blue gags, which a blue gags is a space police or something, and then

493
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,220
they have a police, and then they have a con conversation about this, and then a

494
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,260
sit down, they have a sit down, and then this is like a teaching moment in the

495
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,900
movie, and it's actually the script is actually so beautiful, and then we win an

496
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,200
Oscar for it, because we basically turn barbership into crash. Okay, and then we

497
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,800
would get and then we would get maybe someone I can imagine someone writer of

498
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,260
you that would be like this. It would be like

499
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:19,300
barbership makes you laugh and has thrills aplenty, but I'm left wondering

500
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,180
would racism still exists exist in space and then it would they would kind of go

501
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:28,000
off on that. They can also do be about how there is aliens around

502
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,580
the human race with probably another another review for that might be like

503
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,480
barbership is officially the most racist movie

504
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,620
three white made by two white guys in a core line.

505
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:47,440
This is got to be one of the worst. This is the worst most racist. It's five

506
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,180
hours long and I was long because it starts with two hours of prologue.

507
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,120
That's about the earth being destroyed like

508
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,860
civilized three at the premier. We're all dressed in all white suits.

509
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,300
Nobody's taking photos, just tomatoes getting thrown.

510
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,820
What what happened? What the fuck? Why is everyone mad? Why are you mad about

511
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,340
barbership man? We tried to bring the every world together. We realize that

512
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,380
this shit transcends race is actually it's about species yeah.

513
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,740
There's not you know it should be the and then I mean after the after the

514
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,080
press response to barbership. I think that we know that barbership too is

515
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:25,780
going to be starring Mel Gibson and Kevin Sorbo only people who sign on

516
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,960
and it's an action

517
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,780
barbership

518
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,420
to destroy

519
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,580
nothing to do with the original cast.

520
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,700
The ads Mel Gibson and Kevin Sorber like

521
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,480
them trying to kill the original

522
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
characters.

523
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,420
So we're getting readings of a barbership

524
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,020
Armageddon,

525
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,120
just building a giant laser beam to destroy the barbership, barbary,

526
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,000
barbary, they I'm just saying man. They should have done more barber movies.

527
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,500
Yeah, they made barbershop three. They should be doing every shop. I mean they

528
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,420
should be doing every single movie in space. Also, that should be a given

529
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,880
the s one that should be just a third one should be in space. Always the second

530
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,040
one should always be in Asia summer. Oh yeah, and the third one should always be

531
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,160
in space. Second one should always be in take place during the summer, summer

532
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,440
vacation vacation. Now the first one summer vacation of any movie, the second

533
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,080
one, they should be abroad yeah, and then the third one, they should be up

534
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,040
the third one. There should be a rival and one should always be old west yeah

535
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,920
the third one. The third one deals with a rival thing that arrival like family or

536
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,940
something that in the end you realize that they are basically parallels and they are

537
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,420
not that much different from each other. Like what movie does that? Like Cheaper by the

538
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,760
Dozen 2. Do they have a rival Dozen? It's two Dozens right? It's two Dozens. It's Eugene

539
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,460
Levy vs Steve Martin. In what? A kid off? What the hell? They have a kid off. It's like

540
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,260
Alien vs Predator. Yeah. I've never seen the third one. Well it's the second one. Oh I've

541
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,740
seen the second one. I don't remember that. The second one is Eugene Levy and Steve Martin

542
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,540
than having a child. I thought it was pretty much the same movie, but they got

543
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,260
a bigger house. No, no, no, no, you're thinking of yours, mine and ours.

544
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,080
There's a lot of now. I'm imagining having too many kids that came out. I

545
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,780
imagine imagining now they make a they make a barbership prequel and it's just

546
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,120
on earth and it's still it's barbership three origins. It's just barbershop is

547
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,620
barbershop exactly and then and then they go back for and then they have one

548
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,780
where it's barbership. I think I actually developed it on a boat. Yeah,

549
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,460
master and commander style. Yeah, exactly. It's part of the sea, master and

550
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:47,180
commander, yeah. Oh, yeah, yes, it's like a pirate ship. Yeah, yeah, that's a

551
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,540
good idea. It's just a sail and navy vessel, not a pirate. No piracy involved.

552
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,500
Well, I think pirates are cool, so whatever. Well, there could be a pirate

553
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,700
ship that boards the vessel. They fight and attacks, and that's Mel Gibson and

554
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,740
Kevin Sorbo. That's how they stand. It's their ancestors, and it's why they

555
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,820
became so evil. Yes. Pirate, their ancestors, they had pirate blood. Do you

556
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,780
guys think that I have pirate blood? No. No, not even like the guy who's like

557
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,320
the not even like first main. You maybe have me boy. You have that's what I was

558
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:12,960
saying. Yes,

559
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,760
you could be people talk shit on me. My great great great great grandfather was

560
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,560
me my

561
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,800
doing your

562
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,200
I found out that I'm really

563
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:33,200
me bro. That's not so bad man. I close I'd rather be smith and one of the guys

564
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,380
gets beat up by a kid. Yeah, me gets beat up by a kid hard. No me just chills. No

565
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:43,380
me does not show me. He's not just chill. Me is honestly a representation of the

566
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:48,500
banality of evil. Wow, holy fuck. Evil doesn't always look like a captain hook.

567
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,620
Sometimes it looks like a me. Yeah, speaking of me,

568
00:32:51,620 --> 00:33:01,920
me, me hungry, me hungry, me want food, me very hungry for that's what Venus

569
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,660
fly trap. You're not no, you don't eat a Venus fly trap. I don't know fly. Yeah,

570
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,240
we've been, we've been slowly drifting out of Venus's orbit. Okay, let's, let's

571
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,720
go back, let's bring us back. What do you have to say? I liked barbership.

572
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,200
Barbership was good. Barbership is really good, but then we started talking

573
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,600
about pirates. Okay, let's talk about this, guys. How would you, so Venus is

574
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,400
basically one of the most hostile environments to life as we know it in

575
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,280
the solar system. As we know it. It is hundreds and hundreds of degrees

576
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,440
Fahrenheit there. The atmosphere is so dense that it would crush you from the

577
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:39,180
force of the of the pressure crush some and on me. It would also it also is

578
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,880
poisonous atmosphere. It's sulfur, so you would die from breathing it in.

579
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,820
There's lightning storms, high winds that blow rocks around the planet. It is

580
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,120
pretty pretty much impossible to build a house there. Yeah, but how would you

581
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,620
guys go about it? How would you colonize Venus? How would you get past all these

582
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:55,680
obstacles and build a city there? I wouldn't want to pal city for some

583
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,320
reason. I feel like Venus is the worst planet

584
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,260
really well we could tell by the way that you distant and somebody's a dish I just

585
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,260
saw Amanda she's so fucking beautiful sorry

586
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:12,380
for some reason I completely believe that Venus is trash I think compared to

587
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,660
every other planet is the worst one you would not want to build a colony on I

588
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,220
would not want to build a colony why not bro I could maybe see us building a

589
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,460
colony on Jupiter

590
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,540
or we're not even there we're not even talking about see you said let's bring

591
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,340
coming back to Venus and I say I like Jupiter more. So, so far if we're

592
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,180
going, I don't actually know. I feel like maybe it doesn't. We maybe should have

593
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:37,100
done a little bit more research. Well, I did a bunch of research. He's the

594
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,820
research man. That's true. I'm the artist and you're the rapper. Yeah.

595
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,300
Does Venus have a moon? Does Venus have a moon? What would it look like? Neither

596
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,580
Mercury nor Venus have any moons at all. Oh, because they're too close to the sun.

597
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,820
Yeah, it would get sucked up by the sun probably. So, here's my question and

598
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,740
Maybe there's a video of this, but what would it look like if Venus fell out of

599
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,260
orbit and crashed into the Earth?

600
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
It'd probably explode.

601
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,700
Is there a simulation of what that would look like?

602
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,740
It'd probably look like two planets hitting together.

603
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,740
That's what I like.

604
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,860
Yeah, but isn't Venus just like a ball of gas?

605
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
No, it's not a gas giant.

606
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,860
It's a rocky planet.

607
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
Even a gas giant has stuff on it.

608
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Really?

609
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Yeah.

610
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Huh.

611
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
There's stuff in there.

612
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,860
A little bit.

613
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
A little bit of stuff.

614
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,300
want it crashing into your shit. Yeah, straight up. But Venus is not a

615
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:33,100
gaseous planet though. Oh, I thought it was. It has a gaseous atmosphere. Yes,

616
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:36,540
yes, that's what it is. A very dense atmosphere, but very dense clouds,

617
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:40,700
cloud cover. Cloud city. But it would probably... I bet you could look up a

618
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,900
video of Earth crashing into the moon and then mentally paint it a little

619
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,460
yellow and then you probably would get the same idea. Is it only the size of

620
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,900
the moon? No, it's the size of the Earth. Well, I would wanna see... I'm

621
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,780
just saying it's two planets crashing together. I would wanna see, 'cause

622
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:56,280
it's earth's twin. I would like to see what it would look like if the the I've

623
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,420
seen I just had a good idea guys. What

624
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,100
they are going and this is an idea of something that's going to happen that I

625
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,500
just remembered is happening. They are releasing next week a mortal combat

626
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:09,320
expansion pack where all of the characters are planets and you fight

627
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,660
against you fight against each other as planets and they do fatality. That's

628
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:16,940
true. Is that real? Yeah, I just came up with that and it's true. Oh my God. So

629
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,660
what kind of fatalities would Venus do? Venus crashes into earth and explodes.

630
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,660
that's okay. What does it do that to every planet? Yeah, I guess right now we

631
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,460
have every other planet in his Mercury and yeah, Pluto does that to shut up

632
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,800
don't talk about a different planet. Shut the fuck you asked if every planet

633
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,380
does it you're

634
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:38,580
and I answered you said shut the fuck. It was a trick question. It's not a

635
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,340
trick question. It was a you people. I could tell by your eyes. You were

636
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,820
genuine be more vague. You saw my genuine eyes,

637
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,780
so my genuine smile.

638
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,700
I'm not answering any more questions from either of you guys ever again. Okay,

639
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,380
answer my question. If you're not Coraline man straight up, what question

640
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,740
just answer it bro?

641
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,020
Shut up and answer it. You're such a bitch about it.

642
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,660
Let's see what I was thinking. We can maybe brainstorm some fatalities for

643
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:09,940
planets. Yeah, but we can only talk about Mercury and Earth and Venus right

644
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,900
now. Okay, so we haven't unlocked. I guess we're not allowed to bring it up.

645
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,620
I mean you can say them in comparative, you know, like a parent in comparative

646
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,140
ways, like you can say like, oh, you could fit, you know, you were saying you

647
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,060
could fit four of your Venus. Have you guys ever seen a

648
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,600
a set of twins speaking of Venus being Earth's twin where you're like, oh,

649
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,340
that's Earth and that's Venus. Yes, absolutely. Isn't it interesting they

650
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:40,420
call Venus Earth's twin when I feel like Mars should be its twin. I think Mars is

651
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:44,420
a little bit bigger than Earth, right? Well, twin, but just just their vibe, the

652
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,420
five. Venus is so I don't think Earth is Earth is not doing tick tocks with

653
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,960
Venus and me and my that's my twin in him. No

654
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,900
Venus and Earth are kind of like the twins where it's the two twins who have

655
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,640
rain ones rainbow one the goth yeah exactly yeah speaking of twins Venus and

656
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,260
Serena Serena is definitely the Earth. Why didn't they name her Earth? That's

657
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,580
I've been asking that Venus and Earth Earth Williams.

658
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,980
they name for earth. They are the right there. Serena's she is the earth. I bet

659
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,740
that's her middle name. She's by far the better twin. Is she really yeah dude and

660
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,620
she has a earth style. She looks like earth. She plays a game that's for the

661
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,180
style and her play around earth game. Can you pull that up her, but a giant

662
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:33,980
round, but you pull up a picture of a giant round, but the tennis ball is kind

663
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,540
of like earth. If it had no ocean, that's and had a wax, a white Grand Canyon wall

664
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,720
old China combo that went all the way around in an interesting pattern. A

665
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,560
tennis ball could be a tiny planet and we don't even know. I think about this,

666
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,960
we're kind of, all of our atoms are like planets as well. Yeah, that's true. Do

667
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,760
you guys think that if you zoomed out far enough, we are basically, basically

668
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,320
the planet?

669
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,200
We're toenails on Earth's floor. Yeah, I mean, I guess we could be toenails.

670
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,440
That's incredible. Like stinky atoms on a disgusting nail. Stinky atoms is a

671
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,000
good, is a good atoms family cousin. Wouldn't that suck if we found out that

672
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,740
We are the toenail of a guy named Dave. I do think about that pretty often. We zoom out really far and we're part of something's body.

673
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,040
Yeah. We're germs. I think we definitely are germs.

674
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,640
It is making me think a lot about... Germs.

675
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Germs or no, it's making me think that like

676
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,840
there's no guys on Venus at all.

677
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,640
There's no... That we...

678
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,740
It's true that we know of. It's been making me really scared at night ever since we started the 5 Weeks of Planet.

679
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,940
Ever since we started this I have just been thinking like... It's been making me feel so small.

680
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,460
like oh my god the universe is so big we're nothing man we're complete and

681
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,220
we're not and we're only talking about the Milky Way we're going past the man

682
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:48,260
literally doesn't matter what you do here man. No, nothing matters at all.

683
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,420
Venus is in the Milky Way. That's disgusting. Oh, you said Venus, sir. My

684
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,460
Venus. Yeah, he said Venus, bro. My bad, my bad. I'm so glad God put my Venus in

685
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:01,380
the Milky Way. It sounds like vagina penis. Yeah. What about a planet called

686
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,000
the vagina. I was worried. I'm glad that it that's the real twin of Venus,

687
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,080
vagina, Venus and Pagina

688
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,560
damn when I pulled out my Pagina. That's what it would be called. That's what

689
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:18,400
they would call the Venus's moon is vagina vagina. Did you guys say vagina

690
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,000
when you were a kid? Yes, how much people always say that how often you

691
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,880
say in vagina as a child a lot because you tell your friends. I heard there's

692
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,720
something called a vagina. Yeah, I would say it a lot. I never said vagina. Yeah,

693
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,400
I said it still don't say every single day. I said it every single day guys

694
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,720
really guys really made out like bandits in the name. Why do I feel like that's

695
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,960
a word trump would say but he would say folks they're touching my vagina.

696
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,840
That's like my little brother, so they're pulling they're pulling my pants

697
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:49,720
down and touching my vagina. That's nasty wait who's doing that's not right.

698
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,000
That's not right. Stay that's the D. They should be doing that to try it

699
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,360
doesn't matter who it is. It is pulling down my

700
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:03,760
touching my vagina. They're touching it. Does he? He doesn't sound too happy

701
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,720
about it. He's getting assaulted by the deep state, man. Yeah, that's what he

702
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,720
says all the time. He says he's getting assaulted by the deep state. Fucking

703
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,040
finger him. They're trying to finger my vagina. No, that's nasty. They're saying

704
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,740
I smell, they're saying my vagina smells like skate. Why the hell would they

705
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:23,800
skate the fish? They're naming a specific fish.

706
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:30,040
naming a specific fish that my vagina smells like. Why the hell would they

707
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:35,480
finger it if they thought it smelled like a sting? What the hell are you doing with my pants down

708
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,920
touching my vagina? I don't like this man. You don't like this? It's really nasty. How is this

709
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,920
nasty? It's fucking Trump getting sexually... Trump has a vagina. We don't do this kind of

710
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,000
podcast man. We don't. We're a science podcast. What if Trump was getting sexually assaulted in

711
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:53,480
his vagina by the deep state? We say stuff like... Well what if he said I like it. That makes it

712
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,620
reason. No listen and on this part now that we love it, we're not going to do

713
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,580
to we're not going to trump impressions like that. We're going to do stuff like

714
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:05,320
for example trump. I don't maybe I love it. I'm on Venus and I'm appreciating

715
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,060
the scientific marvels of this planet. Yes, that's a good trumpet. Okay, now do

716
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,720
that okay. We're traveling through the solar system and learning as we go

717
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,140
yeah

718
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,900
learning amazing things

719
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,300
learning, completely amazing thing is educational comedy mother to make a life

720
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,500
after the entire

721
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,260
stop it.

722
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,780
I watched him on a spaceship and he's going to every planet. He's getting

723
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,140
off and he's I had a guide a great trip to Mercury today. It was very cold

724
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,980
Mercury worst planet I've ever seen in the sun came up and it got very, very

725
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,460
hot, completely, completely, must be the hottest planet ever besides Venus.

726
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,940
This is a walk. There's nothing but gray wait. How is is Mars hotter? Sorry,

727
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,380
never mind. Never mind. I haven't unlocked it yet. I'll save it. Mars is

728
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:01,060
the hottest planet in the solar system. But why isn't Earth mega hot as well?

729
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,980
Well, it will be soon. 'Cause we have more zone. Yeah. It's the zone. We got

730
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:08,780
more zone on us. Well, what I learned from my barber today is global warming,

731
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:13,020
it's not real. The Earth just goes through periods. That's what my father

732
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:16,860
said. That's what my parents said growing up, too. Yeah. And he said that's...

733
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,980
That's the most common belief about global warming, I think. It's very... At

734
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:23,380
least until recently. I think recently people started believing. I believe that

735
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,880
man bear pig caused it.

736
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,180
Okay, but you know who's making it worse?

737
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,980
Turd sandwich

738
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,880
slash douche

739
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,680
making it worse man.

740
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,280
Oh election day is very soon. It's election day. I don't even think I'm

741
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,780
registered. Is that next year? No, there's a there's a there's a local

742
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,480
the election day. I was running

743
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:57,660
they're running. I don't know guys. I think I might out of those two options. I

744
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:01,140
honestly feel like I might vote for Pedro. That's a good idea. That's a good

745
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,060
member Pedro

746
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,680
member Pedro.

747
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:13,780
Yeah, I think that turd sandwich. I think Pedro has integrity straight up

748
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:16,280
through no fucking doubt.

749
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:24,240
Yep, God, I need to watch that show again. Seventeen thousand dollars a

750
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:36,460
member Pedro Pedro has Tegrity I'm voting for Pedro instead of a douche

751
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:36,900
entered.

752
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,180
We make seventeen thousand dollars a month, so we can do stuff like that.

753
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:46,980
Yeah, that's true. You know what we did spend some money on? Oh yeah. Big mouth

754
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,460
billy bass right there up on the wall, man. Yep. That's an amazing. That's a

755
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,060
type of animal that could live on Venus, a fish. Yeah. Because they're oceans? No.

756
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,300
I just want to say this before. I was thinking of a flying fish that could swim

757
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,740
through gas. Oh, that can talk? I thought, yeah. Because this one's up on, this

758
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,980
one's up flying. I guess that's true. Before, before we move on from South Park

759
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:08,060
completely. Yeah. I just want to say that me and my friend Rupert kept sending

760
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:16,140
Dumois blind items that were like this dime square scene stir killed and made

761
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:22,180
a killed and made a boy eat his parents at a chili cook. I wish to remain

762
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,980
anonymous. What the hell is Dumois? You don't know. Dumois is like the

763
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,980
celebrity like gossip thing or it's like like things will show up on their

764
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:36,020
Dumois is like you don't know the celebrity gossip. Maybe I would do a

765
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,620
Professor gossip. Yeah, right. My professor. Yeah, that's my version. I

766
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,020
don't know who there's like some shit that Dumois put out that everyone was

767
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:49,220
like this is like so amazing blah blah blah and it's just like so like it's

768
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:54,420
just stupid catty celebrity gossip and yeah, we're just sending them a bunch of

769
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,020
shit saying like Cartman just Cartman stories.

770
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,720
This

771
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,920
This celebrity pretended to be Osimo at a music video.

772
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,920
(laughter)

773
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,920
We were probably doing that for like an hour.

774
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,920
That is funny actually.

775
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,920
That is actually awesome.

776
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,920
I really think that that would be

777
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,920
maybe the logical conclusion to our careers

778
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,920
is that we get hired to be

779
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,920
On Dumois?

780
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
On TMZ type?

781
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,920
No, on South Park.

782
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,920
We would be so good at TMZ.

783
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Matt and Trey, you think we'd be good at TMZ?

784
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,220
I would be really, really good. You would be bad at teams because you get shy

785
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:36,220
about talking to the celebrity. I would I'd would be so fucking good and TMZ. I

786
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,320
love talking shit so much. Oh, my God, and I could wear all sorts of disguises.

787
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,800
I'd be good. I would literally be I would literally be interviewing. I'd be on

788
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,180
the street as a proper at sea talking to the celebrities, interviewing them,

789
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,780
saying like, Oh, my God, I love your dress. Who did your hair and then they'd

790
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,020

824
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,920
a quarter size cheek. His cheek is lower than you think.

825
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,520
I didn't know that.

826
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,120

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,920

830
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,320
Ant. Anya Taylor-Joy. Ant from Opie and Anthony. Yeah, Anya Taylor-Joy.

831
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,620
Did you guys ever see that movie, The Menu? No. That was the worst.

832
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,320
That was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I thought you were going to say The Minion, too.

833
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:45,960
Yeah, I did not want to. I saw the trailers for that movie so many times. I thought it

834
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:50,240
looked so stupid. I could not believe that people wanted to see that movie from the trailer.

835
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,320
I thought that looked annoying, but you know what I did watch was all of the Babish videos

836
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,680
about it. I saw that. I saw that. Andrew Ray. I heard that it ends with a cheeseburger.

837
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:08,560
Respect to Babish. Babish, if you are hearing this, we need you to come next month for Christmas.

838
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,920
We need you to come here and make us a Christmas dinner.

839
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,280
No, not a Christmas dinner.

840
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:19,160
We need to make the four course meal of all of the recipes we created.

841
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,580
I'm still on this.

842
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:21,760
You think Babish needs to do a P.O.W.L. episode?

843
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,920
I think Babish needs to do a Podcast About List episode with us.

844
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,800
How come he's never done any shit like that?

845
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,360
You can do Venture Bros, but you can't do P.O.W.L. man.

846
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,960
What has more cultural cachet?

847
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,440
He did Venture Bros?

848
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,440
Yeah.

849
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
He also has a--

850
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,520
He made the food from Venture Bros.

851
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:41,520
What food is from Venture Bros?

852
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:42,520
Spaghetti and meatballs.

853
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Or maybe he didn't do that.

854
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,520
Maybe somebody else did.

855
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,520
Is there spaghetti and meatballs?

856
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,520
There's a bunch of food on there.

857
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,280
I don't remember there being food in that show at all.

858
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,280
There's food.

859
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,680
I'm sure people eat food, but I'm not imagining--

860
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,680
Never mind.

861
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,640
A different guy did the drinks from Venture Bros.

862
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,640
Oh, I remember the wrong--

863
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,640
Oh.

864
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,640
There's tons of drinks in that, apparently.

865
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
Did he do Fortnite?

866
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,640
Fortnite chug juice.

867
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,480
Yeah, he's made his chug juice before.

868
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:03,480
Noah tried to make me a chug juice.

869
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,960
I want the sheal mushroom, man.

870
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,320
It's that guy, How to Drink.

871
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
You ever see him?

872
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:11,220
you know, I might have he's like just a big but kind of looks. I just watch I

873
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,820
just watched Korean videos with Julio called giant shrimp mistaken as lobster.

874
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:20,440
Oh, yeah, the only time I watch a five hour video basically every other day

875
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,540
called the downfall of SpongeBob when I was living. I just watch I watch. Yeah,

876
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:28,800
I watch either. I watch either most incredible shining sparkly pork meat ever

877
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,540
sold on street. Yeah. And then I watch the history of every tool ever made by

878
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,540
the human race.

879
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,300
That sounds fun.

880
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:43,820
My YouTube channel is connected to the TV and my old roommate Neil would make fun of me

881
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:44,820
all the time.

882
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,820
He's not that old.

883
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,820
Well, he's not my old roommate.

884
00:51:46,820 --> 00:51:48,860
He doesn't live with me anymore.

885
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:54,940
He would bring this up all the time to every single person that knows who I am.

886
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,260
He opened up the YouTube one day and there was a video that was pretty much almost all

887
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:04,760
all the way watched about the downfall of White Castle and he told every single

888
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:09,960
person that I know that I watched a fucking two hour. It's fine. It is such a

889
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,920
life saver to me that my girlfriend's YouTube is logged into the TV, so it's

890
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,160
all vlogs when I turn it on and it's I don't have to be assaulted with the

891
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,220
horrible things. I'm mine is mine. Any time my wife turns on the TV to watch a

892
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,740
video of a lady walking through a house, she always has to scroll by like ten

893
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:33,480
videos of guys playing blackjack. Yeah, and I yeah, sorry, fuck you. Yeah, it's all

894
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,380
the trying to try videos. Yeah, too lazy to try Kevin Hart wore a dress and he's

895
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:41,300
in the Illuminati. Yeah, and I'm going, oh, I don't know. I watch too many. I

896
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:46,100
watch too many Elden Ring PVP clips and now my entire recommend front page on

897
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,160
YouTube is just all videos of guys with beards and it's like Elden Ring run, but

898
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:57,480
is epic. I'll do a mean character. Damn mine will be some of the smartest thing

899
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,740
you've things you've ever seen in your entire life, like something about kind

900
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,480
of Kierkegaard or Camus that type of thing very kind of cool videos that are

901
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,760
eleven minutes long and then a four hour video about Rocco's modern life. Yeah,

902
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,020
and these are kind of staggered because you have to listen. You can have candy,

903
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,100
but you got to eat your best. Yeah, that's true. That my vegetables is

904
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,960
Theanderthal videos. My, I guess... There are vegetable videos. Am I just only eating

905
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,760
candy? And you like, every once in a while, you crave the vegetable videos. I think I'm

906
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,240
only, yeah, I guess my vegetable... You're a full candy video? I watch a vegetable video

907
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,560
every once in a while. My vegetable videos are... I only watch vegetable videos right

908
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,600
now, I think. Yeah, you're only watching like... I go in phases where I'll go full veggie.

909
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,800
I used, I think I, I think I basically, I was over-served in candy in my, my young adult

910
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,800
life and I can't, I can't do it anymore. Can't no more candy for you. No, yeah. What was

911
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,380
used to fall asleep to eating can. I'm about half it. I'm about half and half.

912
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:53,220
I try to fall asleep to the best. I used to I used to every night fall asleep to

913
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,100
eating five hours

914
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:59,680
yeah. It's not good for you make you a bad. So now I just try to if I have some

915
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,000
down time, I'll eat some vegetables between three and four last night and I

916
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,600
better dreams. If I if the last video I watch is a vegetable versus a candy last

917
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,980
night, I watch a candy video before I went to bed and I had a dream that I was

918
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,360
trapped in a million stack of pancakes. Whoa today this morning I was woken up

919
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,160
because my girlfriend was in bed next to me and she sneezed and it it startled me

920
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,520
really bad when I woke up like I went and then I looked over at her and I don't

921
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,920
remember this because I still mostly sleep, but I looked at her like this.

922
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:31,000
I was really, really mad. I woke up twice last night. One was from the pancake

923
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,800
thing, but the first time I woke up was I woke up. I was having a dream where I

924
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,160
was fight. I was doing like Kung Fu or something and a woman in a red gi was

925
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,400
coming at me and I woke up doing it. I literally jumped out of bed doing this

926
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,700
and then I just and then I just had to and I before I even process what I'd

927
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:53,600
done. I was going to the bathroom to piss, but I ran up with my hands cocked

928
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:57,600
lethal weapons ready to kill him. I woke up like five times last night because

929
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,200
the tickets for the new Godzilla movie went on sale during last night, but they

930
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,800
went on there. There was no time time what they were going on sales. I thought

931
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,500
they're going to be at midnight and then they didn't my body. I was like I'm

932
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,700
I was going to set an alarm for like six AM and wake up and try to get them, but

933
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:15,980
my body woke me up like every hour to check naturally. I had a natural clock

934
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:19,500
for my body wanting to Christmas, Christmas, but yeah, and then Pierce

935
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,780
got them for me. I still get Christmas sleep on Christmas and I don't even get

936
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,500

937
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:28,740

I have to go to the grocery store. The next day I have Christmas. Christmas

939
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:36,900
sleep is one of the worst sleeps you'll ever have. You know, absolutely I

940
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,400
- I, during Christmas, I wake up and I,

941
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,900
or I'll wake up 40 times on Christmas Eve night,

942
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,960
and then I wake up and I get nothing.

943
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,220
- There's nothing to have.

944
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,520
- But I just like the spirit of it so much

945
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,360
that I love spirit.

946
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,340
- You know what I got for Christmas?

947
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:53,400
- Spirit Christmas would be a good store.

948
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,860
- For Christmas two years ago,

949
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,920
my aunt buys like all this shit.

950
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:58,820
- Your aunt's buy.

951
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,560
- My aunt buys all this shit in advance.

952
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,440
So she doesn't really like vet anything.

953
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,440
She doesn't ask my mom, like,

954
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,000
"Oh, would so-and-so wear this?"

955
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,680
And two years ago, she got me this True Religion V-neck.

956
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,400
That's beast, dude.

957
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,720
Did I? I think I gave that to you.

958
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,880
No.

959
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,240
All right. It was in the costume closet for sure.

960
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,040
It might have been destroyed in the flood.

961
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,680
No.

962
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,480
But it was like metallic,

963
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,640
overprint True Religion V-neck.

964
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,760
That is so sick.

965
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:34,920
And it was like two sizes too small.

966
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,160
It's like something that like the guys who wear,

967
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,000
who like give ethical loan samples at the mall would wear.

968
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,200
You should wear a dress like that.

969
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,120
Dude, I should, maybe I should get those biker jeans.

970
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,200
My aunt Phyllis was giving away until the last couple of years.

971
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,040
She was giving away just,

972
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,320
she bought a bunch of gift cards a long time ago and then would just give them

973
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,680
away. Cause they lasted like three years or whatever.

974
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:00,240
And one time I did get an expired Blockbuster gift card for Christmas after

975
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,360
Blockbuster had, it was like the year that it just didn't exist anymore.

976
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,040
and she just nobody told her. She was really upset when I was like...

977
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,640
My aunt got me the Game of Thrones trivia game.

978
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,680
You got me something that doesn't exist?

979
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,840
Literally doesn't exist. This money is just gone.

980
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:15,840
This is nothing?

981
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
There is nothing.

982
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
It's just a piece of plastic.

983
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:18,840
You have no recourse.

984
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,840
Yeah.

985
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,480
My aunt got me the game of... the same aunt got me the Game of Thrones trivia cards, like

986
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,400
Game of Thrones trivia game.

987
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,400
Why are we not playing that?

988
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,840
I've never watched it in my life.

989
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,840
I watched the first season.

990
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,240
I watched three seasons.

991
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,920
I watched I think one season. I read a bunch of them. I read like two and a half of the

992
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,280
books and then I read the, well watched the first season. So I could probably be okay

993
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,360
at it. You'd be better at that game than me. I know some of the characters names. Daenerys

994
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:50,800
Targaryen y'all. What is that? She's the queen. She's basically the dragon queen. Okay. She

995
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,840
gets, I know what's his name? Aquaman fucks her. Thule. Fucked. Who's Thule? I just made

996
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:02,080
him up. Oh, there's a guy with no penis. There's a guy named Theon. He has no balls I guess.

997
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,840
Theon. Oh yeah, I remember that guy. What was that called? A eunuch. There's a eunuch in

998
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,600
it. Did they cut your balls and your dick off? I don't know. I think just your balls

999
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:15,920
maybe. What's Dinka's name in the show? Dinka's name is Dinka. No, Dinka. Lil' Dinka. Who's

1000
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:23,280
Dinka? Peter Dinka. Oh, Peter Dinklage? Peter Dinka? Tyrion. Tyrion. Tyrion Lannister. Oh,

1001
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,520
The Lannisters and they're fucking each other man.

1002
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:30,520
The Lannisters, the Targaryens, the Starks, the Monsters.

1003
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,520
That's all I know.

1004
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,520
The Dragons.

1005
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,420
Leo was telling me this story, I forget who it was but he was saying that like.

1006
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,080
I know who's story it was.

1007
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,160
Whose was it?

1008
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,160
Jeremy Lovix.

1009
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,220
Oh okay.

1010
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,360
And you're stealing it bro.

1011
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:47,660
No I'm, yeah I guess I'm stealing it but it still makes me laugh so hard.

1012
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:53,160
He was doing some like improv show or something before a jazz band and then the jazz band like

1013
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:59,080
no one liked the improv show and then the jazz band went up and was like, "Get a load of

1014
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,080
those guys." And then the crowd was like, "Yeah, ha ha ha," was on his side and he said, "Alright,

1015
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:11,080
I guess I should tell a joke now. Peter Dinka is the most famous midget of all time." That

1016
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,680
was the whole joke.

1017
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:20,680
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I'd be laughing if Jeremy told me that maybe because that was his story.

1018
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,080
Yeah, Jeremy, that's your story.

1019
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,080
You gotta apologize right now.

1020
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,080
I gotta apologize.

1021
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,080
Can you punch in on me?

1022
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,200
Jeremy, it's your friend Patrick.

1023
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,000
I told a third hand story of yours.

1024
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,920
Do you have like a sad song you can play?

1025
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
I'm trying to figure it out.

1026
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
Wait, I got a sad song.

1027
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,480
Alright, just start talking and I'll fade in the sad song.

1028
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,720
Hey Jeremy, it's your friend Patrick.

1029
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,080
I am a little bit under the weather.

1030
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:58,080
There's a lot going on in my life right now that's making me a little bit fucked up.

1031
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:03,080
And I told the third-hand story of yours and I told it wrong.

1032
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,080
I apologize.

1033
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,080
What are you doing?

1034
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,080
Is this not genuine?

1035
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1036
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,080
Can you start it over?

1037
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:09,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1038
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:21,520
Hey Jeremy, Levick from the Jeremy and Rajat video series. It's your friend Patrick Dorn

1039
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:28,800
from Podcast About List. I told a third hand story that our friend Leo, Darth Erogenous

1040
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:33,560
on Twitter told me, and it wasn't my story.

1041
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,820
(laughing)

1042
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:42,160
- Wait, that was actually fire.

1043
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,200
It can't be that, you know.

1044
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,280
- Yep.

1045
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,440
- All right, Venus.

1046
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,280
- You ghosted.

1047
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,480
- You ghosted.

1048
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,560
We never talk about you again, man.

1049
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,440
- We didn't even want to talk about you on this show.

1050
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,260
And you know what?

1051
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,680
There's gonna be a Hit 'Em Up style track releasing soon.

1052
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,640
- With all three of us.

1053
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,520
all three of us rapping about how fucking bunk you are. What do we have

1054
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,520
dropping next on the next week of planets?

1055
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,000
We got a painting, Mercury, Venus, a new painting from, from,

1056
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
what's my painting name? DJ Alamos

1057
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:20,480
about Mars, about Mars. We will have a Mars planet report as well. And what

1058
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,920
will we have also? We are gonna have a collab of the century.

1059
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:32,160
Maybe an old friend might stop by. Maybe an old musical friend of ours. And you might

1060
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,120
know who it is. And our new musical friend. Our new musical friend will be collaborating

1061
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:46,120
with our old musical friend from our American Idol episode. So be on the lookout for that.

1062
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:53,640
And be on the lookout for me in Chicago tomorrow. And guys, November 17th, the biggest show ever

1063
01:01:53,640 --> 01:02:11,960
for

1064
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:20,960
not a bad idea. I got bad news. What's that? What's the bad news? We have a

1065
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,200
mid-earth threshold. Oh my gosh. Wait, okay, we have a change.org petition. I

1066
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,000
didn't even realize we did this. I forgot that we did this. I forgot about this

1067
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,960
too. 21 signatures, we need four more signatures for guys to leave the galaxy.

1068
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,600
Basically, we're trying to make it known that we don't want to leave the galaxy,

1069
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:51,160
With space travel advancing at a rapid rate, it seems as though civilian space travel to

1070
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,160
outer space is a thing of the past and will soon be in the age of outer galaxy travels.

1071
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:01,320
With some of our brightest minds, Elon Musk's Dave Chappelle and Mark Zuckerberg might think

1072
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,780
This is a good idea.

1073
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,200
Visual storytellers, EA, Ubisoft, Nintendo,

1074
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,840
have already been warning us for decades

1075
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,440
that this might be a really bad idea.

1076
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,360
That's why we as Podcast About List invite you all,

1077
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,560
want to invite you all, the world,

1078
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,280
to let our global representatives know

1079
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,640
that we feel like we shouldn't leave our galaxy

1080
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:20,800
for the sake of not signaling our position

1081
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,920
and invite cosmic horrors and space bandits into our home.

1082
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,160
Please guys, let's not leave the galaxy.

1083
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,960
And then this is a Mass Effect 2.

1084
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,000
- Your contact lenses just arrived.

1085
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
1-800-CONTACTS. They can't have my brand. I have special eyes.

1086
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Sleep with your special eyes.

1087
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000

01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Wow. A Source Filmmaker video.

1089
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
And Abraham Stewart says it's too scary.

1090
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Steven Washington, I like this galaxy. It's fine. Why do we need another galaxy?

1091
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
He said, "What owe we Neif another one for anyway?"

1092
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Exactly. That's what I've been saying.

1093
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
We don't want oafs and doofuses signing our thing. It dilutes our point.

1094
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,560
you all reasons. How many supporters do we have right now? Twenty one twenty one

1095
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,560
supporters, so one one. Can you do something for me? Not can you send this

1096
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:12,000
petition to four friends? Can you do this? Everybody text this petition to

1097
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,760
everybody in your contact or you'll be

01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,920
send out a blast unless you want to get dead spaced man, I don't know blast or

1099
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,200
something and tell them to check out the five weeks of planets. Ask people if

1100
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,280
they know about the five. Here's a script you can use for telling people the

1101
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,760
five weeks of plans that I've already been using with some of my friends.

1102
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,880
Hello? You say, "Hey, have you heard about the five weeks of planets?"

1103
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,880
They say, if they say no, you know what you say? You will soon.

1104
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,480
Oh, and if they say yes? That's it.

1105
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:38,720
Oh, that's it. Okay. If they say yes. If they say yes, say cool.

1106
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,480
Cool, me too. I've heard of that.

1107
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,480
Yeah, I also know about it.

1108
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,880
All right, boy. I'll see you later.

1109
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:51,880
And you guys, I need to debut my new single.

1110
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,880
Okay, I want to hear it.

1111
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,360
My new single under my new space rapping name

1112
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:06,280
OJ the alien. All right. I want to hear this shit. Okay. Are you guys are you all seeing this? I'm listening to your stream mate

1113
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:23,280
Mercury, I'm gonna fly to you Mercury, I'm at your knee and you

1114
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:33,280
Mercury, I'm gonna fly to you Mercury, I'm at your knee and you

1115
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:53,280
*music*

1116
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,280
See I'm doing an alien voice. I hear that.

1117
01:05:55,280 --> 01:06:15,280
Mercury, I'm gonna fly to you. Mercury, imagine me and you. Mercury, I'm gonna fly to you. Mercury, imagine me and you.

1118
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,280
Mercury, let me fuck on you one time

1119
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,280
Hope I make you wet with my dope rhyme

1120
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,280
On this planet you age like a fine wine

1121
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,280
So around you look like a fine time

1122
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,280
Put my nut in you like a Clark car

1123
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,280
I put my butt on you but I won't fart

1124
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,280
Pull my spaceship here like a pair of hearts

1125
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,280
Got my clothes and shoes they from Primark

1126
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,280
Mercury, let me fuck on you one time

1127
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,280
Hope I make you wet with my dope rhyme

1128
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,280
Like a fine line?

1129
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:49,560
I'd let the Adobe Premiere do the transcription.

1130
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,520
I think that was a... I should've double-checked that.

1131
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:01,520
Mercury, imagine me and you, Mercury.

1132
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,520
*Growl*
