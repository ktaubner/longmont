(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,840
(explosion)

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,160
- Okay.

10
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,000
- Oh!

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,920
- No.

12
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,740
- No.

13
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,720
- Yeah, Patrick's stomach hurts.

14
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,560
- Yep.

15
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,400
- Oh!

16
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,360
- Me and Patrick showed up to Cameron's house

17
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,200
and he immediately started shitting

18
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,040
and I started to--

19
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,860
- I didn't shit.

20
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,700
- I went, I walked out.

21
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,540
- What do you mean you didn't shit?

22
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,360
I fucking heard you.

23
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,200
- I farted.

24
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,040
- I know.

25
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:29,860
- That's how that came out.

26
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,460
I heard water. That was me drinking? No. You can't pretend you didn't shit, you liar.

27
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,940
I was hitting a bomb. You shit. No, I did not shit. You're a fucking liar. I heard it.

28
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:45,780
Yeah, that was a fart. No. No. When it becomes that wet, it's not a fart.

29
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,300
You're a fucking illegal. Good point. Good point. Yeah. Yeah. It was a fart I had to wipe after,

30
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,340
so that is a shit. What the fuck? That's a shit, dude. What are you talking about?

31
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,540
Any solid mass that comes out eats shit, man.

32
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,540
How would you say you didn't shit?

33
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,540
Stuff came out of your butt and you had to wipe it off

34
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,540
and you were sitting on the toilet and you're trying to say you didn't shit?

35
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,540
No, but you don't understand, it was solid fart.

36
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,540
It wasn't shit. It was solid fart.

37
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,540
It was solid fart. A fart can be kind of solid.

38
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,540
A frozen fart.

39
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,540
That was one of the...

40
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,540
I'm trying to not get chips every time I go to the bodega.

41
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,540
And I got dried apricots.

42
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,540
And I ate a whole thing of dried apricots

43
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,540
and then looked up later

44
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,540
that dried apricots can give you diarrhea

45
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
or they can be used to induce diarrhea.

46
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
So what did you search for that?

47
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,540
Do you usually search whatever food you eat and then diarrhea after a few hours later?

48
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,540
That's your...

49
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,540
Well if I'm experiencing diarrhea that bad...

50
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
Yeah, that's smart. I'm down with that.

51
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,540
I would google it before I ate it.

52
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,540
Well I don't think about that.

53
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,540
If you're eating apricots, you're not thinking...

54
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,540
The last thing you're thinking is these are used to induce diarrhea medically.

55
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,540
That's prunes. Prunes you think that immediately.

56
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,340
I guess prunes it I guess a prune is just a purple apricot. Yeah, it kind of is. Yeah

57
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,760
So you did kind of fuck yourself? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you heard that that was like an eight-second fart

58
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,660
That was like the grossest. I had I put one in the hallway. I

59
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:09,480
Dusted his fucking next-door neighbor guys are so disgusting. Caleb was like literally

60
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,540
We can't ever go we can't was like we can't ever record a Cameron's apartment ever again

61
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,540
And then today's like can we please record your apartment? I need a fart really bad

62
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,040
I had to come over here, I had to lay down such a long bro.

63
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
We had a stink conspiracy.

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,720
Cameron, every time I have to record at my house, Cameron says I have to use your

65
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,440
bathroom and then he torches it.

66
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,040
That's not true.

67
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,840
You torch it.

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,540
That's not true.

69
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,040
You torch my bathroom.

70
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,240
I've been in there after you.

71
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,640
And you know what, my house sucks so bad because my house, the bathroom is the

72
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,240
gateway to the entire home.

73
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
You have to walk by the bathroom.

74
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,240
Yeah, well in this apartment, it's the gateway to the bedroom, which is where my

75
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,240
girlfriend sits and we're recording so it's actually worse. That is worse. That's way

76
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:59,840
worse. Yeah. Yeah. I guess, alright. Feel free to torch my bathroom whenever. Yeah, I'm just

77
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,840
glad we don't go to my place because it wouldn't have any effect. Yeah. It wouldn't change.

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,080
Well, my place now, I'm moving soon. I have definitely shit. And on the 28th I will reveal

79
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,600
my old address. I have shit at your house and left the toilet cleaner than it was

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,480
when I started shitting. Well I have shit with enough velocity that it's scraped

81
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
away. Whenever you go in and you have like diarrhea. We haven't been in my house in a while.

82
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:37,080
If you go into Pat's bathroom, not true, you go into Pat's bathroom and you have diarrhea, it will be normal and nice because that bathroom is used to having two guys have diarrhea in there at a time.

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,460
your toilet. Have you ever seen like when some really old house somebody will

84
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:46,560
take the paint off and there's like 18 layers? That is the brown like piss and shit.

85
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,420
I put the blue thing in there. And there's layers of blue stuck between

86
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:54,200
because you probably... I put three of those blue the scrubbing bubbles things in it. Put three?

87
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah. It was that bad? You still have to scrub though. No I do now. You do? Uh-huh. You're

88
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,840
really scrubbing your shit? I took an Adderall and I bought a bunch of

89
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,920
a toilet. You had to take an Adderall to scrub your toilet. No, I had to take an Adderall

90
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:16,160
to well I mean yeah I'm not gonna do that shit sober. Not cleaning my toilet sober bro. Adderall

91
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,200
is like super sober. Yeah. Adderall is is like the limitless pill and you start to do things

92
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,680
that you were supposed to do but forgot to. Like not get a boner and not come. Like yeah

93
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,280
or create 100,000 custom Magic the Gathering cards in an hour. Yeah. Those are all the

94
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,400
things that you had to do yeah yeah that's I found my old my old files of

95
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,840
custom magic the gathering cards and I like open it like a show on a nearly

96
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,560
when I was taking Adderall in high school and I would just like have to like

97
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,440
have to do homework and just take an Adderall and I like I literally open up

98
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,200

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,040
wow I don't even have the energy to read the I had an amphetamine induced budget

100
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
that I made and it was literally like it was like four days of me getting receipts

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,320
and and putting them into a Google Doc yeah and it was like the most useless

102
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,320
information. That's what I would do I would take I would take Adderall and I'd be

103
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,920
like I'm gonna type out a list of every album of music I've ever listened to

104

105
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,000
videos. Yeah it doesn't make you do anything you actually have to.

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,840
- Well, I, if I use it--

107
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,360
- I'm still searching for my favorite drug, I think.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
- Yeah?

109
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,040
- Yeah, I'm still looking.

110
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,000
All the drugs are pretty bad.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,840
- Hi, Mom.

112
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,680

- It's crap and pee.

118
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,120
- She wishes, dude.

119
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
- Yeah, she wishes I wasn't addicted to that.

120
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,640
- You're addicted to taking--

121
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,880
(laughing)

122
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,720
- Wow, man.

He takes it every day.

125
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,280
That's why he has a stomachache right now.

00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,580
He wakes up every day, takes a Plan B.

127

- Takes a Plan B.

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,840
- And he gives himself a really bad stomachache

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,800
so he can go fart prank all of his friends.

130

I saw a homeless guy.

155
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,800
He had two signs and one sign said fear no woke mob, fear only God.

156
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,600
And then the other sign said cancel monsters, look like fools in the city.

157
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,880
That's right.

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,880
Cancel monsters.

159
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,740
- What is he talking about there?

160
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,300
Cancel monsters.

161
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,020
- Cancel monsters.

162
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,080

- Yeah.

164
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,860

- Yeah.

168
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,540

199
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,720
If you're from Long Island, get over here. If you're a stand-up comic from Long Island,

200
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,440
we need you on here. If you're playing at clubs called Chuckle's Laugh Hut,

201
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,880
we need to get DePaulo. DePaulo's not from Long Island, he's from Boston.

202
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,400
Nick DePaulo's from Boston? Well, now I trust him even more.

203
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,560
Isn't that crazy? Doesn't he seem like such a Long Island guy? He's from fucking Boston.

204
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,320
Because I don't recognize Boston Italians.

205
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,440
Well he's an Italian, Long Island is Italian Boston.

206
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,600
Yeah that's true. I think there's a kinship between those two.

207
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
What kind of kinship could that be?

208
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,160
White.

209
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:28,280
Yeah I think it might be some kind of white plus awesome factor that they have. Those two.

210
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,760
White plus awesome equals Boston and Long Island.

211
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,840
That's a really good comedy special name.

212
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,840
White plus Boston equals awesome.

213
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,840
White plus Boston equals awesome.

Awesome plus Boston equals white.

217
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,840
Boston minus white equals Long Island.

218
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Boston minus white equals trouble.

219
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,840

Can we edit?

284
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,600
I know somebody has a palm tattoo. Even just talking about that, look at how sweaty my

285
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,920
hand got. Do you see that?

286
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,960
Your hand was not. He's covering his tracks.

287
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,200
He mentioned it to cover up how sweaty his hand got.

288
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,120
Look at how sweaty my arm. I'm scared. I'm scared of getting a palm tattoo.

289
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,920
Guys do you ever think about Dracula? Whoa, look how sweaty I got just now. That's why

290
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
I'm so sweaty.

291
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,040
You know what, I'd be scared of a stigmata. Hold on.

292
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,580
stuff really freaks me out when like somebody hurts their hand it makes my

293
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,200
hand sweat. You see my you don't feel it? So you think that you think that

294
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,400
it's not there anymore. Our King of Kings is freaky. Yeah. Well that's what it comes

295
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,540
from is that I'm so touched by the Word of God. I don't think so. I think you

296
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,400
think he's freaky. I don't think he's freaky. I think you want you want to put him on a

297
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,560
Goosebumps cover because you think he's so scary. No. Nope. Not at all. That would be a

298
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,860
fire-ass cross that would be pretty tight Jesus Jesus bumps yeah well okay so it's

299
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,220
like a family of God they ever do they should do just like a Christian like

300
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:34,740
goose bumps they should really Christian SNL yeah and then why not do could

301
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,140
actually videos no that's not Christian SNL you never watch that shit was

302
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:45,780
muffling if it's not SNL how come that motherfucking squash dress up like Elvis

that was some Andy Kaufman shit that was on the next level no dude it was crazy

304
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,580
VeggieTales is not Christian SNL. Then name what is okay it's the it's the

305
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,860
Christian Simpsons obviously there's no Christian Simpsons VeggieTales VeggieTales

309
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,300

310
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,780
done talking to you.

311
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:26,540

Yeah.

316
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,260
Yeah, I mean, I don't know why you jumped to like immediately like an old babysitter

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,280
sphere yeah and then every year that they do that there's always somebody

335
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:01,040
post like my kid saw a guy's cock and balls out why'd you take the kid to the

336
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,980
Yeah, you can smell that fucking street from a mile away.

337
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,080
Why are you getting anywhere near that with your child?

338
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,480
I would love to go through there with a leaf blower.

339
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,640
I think that would be funny.

340
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,880
You'd like to go through there with one of those fucking

341
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,480
things a dentist gives you that sticks your mouth open

342
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,320
like this.

343
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,840
(laughing)

344
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,720
Just kind of catch shit and be unable to close your mouth.

345
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,560
That's what you want to do.

346
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,520
The latex one, when they're putting a crown on.

347
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,680
The one that goes like this.

348
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,080
You know, it just keeps everything in your mouth

349
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
perfectly exposed.

350
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah, I'd be using the--

351
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
I'd be going in there with a vacuum instead.

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'd be going in there with the dentist moisture sucker and I'd have a vacuum bag on my back like a Ghostbuster and I'd be sucking up anything I see.

353
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Catching pee?

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Some fat old guy in like a metal tub, covered in, he's like, "Piss on me, five dollars."

355
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You go up there, steal all of his pee and he gets mad at you.

356
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm building a homunculus from all of your DNA.

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This is gonna be the biggest person in the world.

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm making gay Frankenstein.

359
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,520
Uh-huh. All this pee is gonna synthesize together to create the world's tallest person.

360
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,960
I want to make a homunculus pretty bad. Yeah. You guys remember that video?

361
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,120
Uh-huh. The guy who injects semen in an egg? Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty cool.

362
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,280
That's more like homo-culus, because he's putting his damn semen in a male egg.

363
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:23,040
How do you know it's a male egg? You can tell it. Male eggs are brown. Girl eggs are white.

364
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,320
Is that true? Yeah. I had chickens when I lived in New Hampshire.

365
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,720
So I'm paying extra to eat a male egg and kind of--

366
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, yeah, because it's got more testosterone.

367
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
And I--

368
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
That's why the egg is brown.

369
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Absorb his essence, right?

370
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Uh-huh.

371
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Okay.

372
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
That makes sense to me.

373
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
That's why eating eggs is good.

374
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,040
That's why eggs are the best food you can eat.

375
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,200
I do eat a lot of eggs.

376
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Yeah.

377
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,880
I know your stanky ass didn't have no chickens.

378
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,880
Yeah, I did.

379
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
No, you didn't.

380
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Yeah, we did.

381
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,720
They kept getting eaten by a fox.

382
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,200
You just kept fucking feeding this fox.

383
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Sounds like you had a fox.

384
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Yeah.

385
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,320
More or less out of fog. Yeah, you were getting you fed him chickens. Yeah, cuz yeah that barn

386
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,640
Remember now remember that bar. No, you never I forgot I forgot you went to New Hampshire

387
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,920
But you got down for the farm. No the barn the barn it was a barn farm

388
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Okay, darn the darn the dark the yarn the farm was next door and they had maple syrup tubes all through her backyard

389
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,820
You're just making up a Willy Wonka fucking fuck factory in New Hampshire was starring a chicken and Tim

390
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,000

392
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:37,260

393
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,540
anything I forgot to change my ID no matter gonna hack your ID card well I

394
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,740
I don't want them to look at my ID.

395
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,180
- What does that mean?

396
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,980
- My picture, I look so young in my picture.

397
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,180
- What do you mean, how would they find your picture?

398
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,140
- They're gonna find me in a database

399
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,820
and they're gonna see how young I look.

400
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,020
- There's a database of every ID.

401
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,740
- Why would they be able to search your old address

402
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,580
but not your full name?

403
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,940
- They're gonna find my ID.

404
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,620
(laughing)

405
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,580
- You have like the stupidest idea of privacy

406
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,340
of anybody I've ever met.

407
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,300

416
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,780

417
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,660
white egg. It's true. See, it's true. There's a certain way you're saying it

'cause we are talking about cool-ass daddy-o black eggs.

433
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,580
And then all of a sudden,

434
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,140
you're the inventor of the black egg?

435
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
- I'm not the inventor.

436
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,180
I found it on Facebook or something.

437
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,700
I sent you guys the black egg.

438
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,540

441
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,080
- Yep, I remember that, actually.

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:28,920
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

Let me see if I can find it.

444
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,820
- Okay, so yeah, it's fine to sell black eggs then.

445
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,660
And we're gonna make a million bucks.

446
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
- Yep.

447
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,460
We're gonna find that chicken.

448
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,940
- We have to find, here it is.

449
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,980
- There's a blue chicken.

450
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,700
- The black chicken.

451
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,420
- Oh my God, those are black eggs.

452
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,340
- It's the black chicken that lays black eggs.

453
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,500
And it was posted on a Facebook group called Earth Unreal.

454
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,060
- That is unreal.

455
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,420
- I'll send this picture to you guys

456
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,940
so everyone can see, we'll post it.

457
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,420
- I hung out with chickens last weekend.

458
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,980
Do not like them.

459
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,100
- They suck, dude.

460
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,420
- I thought I liked chickens 'cause of a video

461
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,260
- With a chicken?

462
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,100
- Are you like, shit, dog?

463
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,700
- No, they fucking chase you around, dude.

464
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,540
- Dude, it thinks, the roosters are fucking nasty to me.

465
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,980
- Roosters are, ugh.

466
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,820
- They're crazy nasty.

467
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,300
- They try to get up, I was on--

468
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,960
- No, we had a rooster for a little bit

469
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,920
and then that got picked off.

470
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,020
- Yeah, I was on a farm in Western Mass last year

471
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,580
and there was like, you could go pet the animals and stuff

472
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,120
and there was a bunch of little kids there

473
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,700
and the chickens are just chasing all the kids.

474
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,540
- Shit.

475
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,360
- It's like, little, yeah, the chicken,

476
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,980
they're like the same size as the kids and they put the parent yeah the parents

477
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,520
are like they put their arms up like that they start running after you yeah

478
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,340
they do they chase when they reach out their hands and they go yeah yeah but

479
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,800
the other love to chase kids and nobody does anything about it that's well

480
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:49,100
Colonel Sanders that's true that's true he's he saw what was happening yeah I

481
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,460
chasing the children around I would love to like Norm Macdonald what remember

482
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,860
Norm Macdonald was Colonel Sanders for a year?

483
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Yeah, I was doing Norm Macdonald.

484
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
That was pretty funny.

485
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,860
That's what he sounded like, Norm Macdonald.

486
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,580
It was just so funny to have every other Colonel Sanders be like, "Well, I'm with the chicken

487
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,140
is the..." and then just one guy's like, "Ah, chicken.

488
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Ah, fucking.

489
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
Yeah, it's good.

490
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
Can't see.

491
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
Ah, it's fucking herbs and spices."

492
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,940
I do want to be...

493
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,460
My goal, honestly, in life is to be a fast food mascot at some point.

494
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,300
Yeah, they're only, hey, all fast food mascots nowadays, they're making them all girls, so

495
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
good luck.

496
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,700
He's already the mascot of Big Boy.

be a really good you'll be really good Wendy I really I feel like the goal is

500
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:44,460
good you'd be like a good grimace how am I grimace straight-up grimace grimace

501
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,040

502
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:54,120
hair no he's not blobby you blob he's not purple blob your gumdrop used to be a

503
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,520
spider you know that he's a spider grimace I used to be a spider in the

504
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:04,440
70s 1973 grimace was a spider I was a spider how long three - probably a little

505
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,320
bit I want to crack him open yeah see what kind of these are these guys is an

506
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,520
egg I think he is a purple egg yeah no guy he's not he's a monster he's not a

507
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:19,080
a monster. Don't be ridiculous. He is not a monster. He's Ronald's friend. He's a

508
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,640
monster and he's not a friend. He's evil. I feel like the best. He was evil and then

509
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,080
he had a turn. People like that. You don't know shit about McDonald's grubber. Monsters like Grimace never go good. I feel like the

510
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,100
best, the best role is obviously. They never go good. The best role is obviously Ronald. Yeah.

511
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,860
Yeah. But I'm not sure. No the best role is that new little Happy Meal guy. They

512
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,480
replaced Ronald. You are on a crusade about this guy. I hate him. He does suck. He's

513
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
sucks. What if we got a new Taco Bell mascot? My nephew is being indoctrinated into liking

514
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,480
this. Oh, a new Taco Bell mascot could be really good actually. Yeah. A Chihuahua? Not a Chihuahua.

515
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,040
No, a new one. Maybe like a... So a new dog. Maybe like a banker. A bull mastiff that eats

516
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:09,920
Taco Bell. I could play Pitbull. Yeah. In a TV movie. Yeah, say Dale. That I could play

517
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,720
very well. That's actually the ultimate Taco Bell mascot. We used to have a

518
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,760
chihuahua, now we have... A Cuban guy. Yeah. The ultimate Taco Bell mascot. A clearly Cuban man. I don't know if he's

519
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,440
clearly Cuban. If I look exactly like him, I don't think he can be

520
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:31,960
clearly Cuban. Well, you don't look... you look exactly like him by choice. What do

521
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:36,880
you mean? You think that he doesn't choose to shave his head? No, he has no... he

522
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,000
lasers that shit off he's got money. He's a reptilian. It's still a choice though. Yeah he's got

523
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:49,940
reptilian dollars. He's a reptilian heir. Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised if Pibble

524
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:54,520
claimed in a song that he's a bazillionaire. That's so cool that

525
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,520
chameleonaires name is actually because he like they said he looked like a

526
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:03,320
chameleon. Yeah he's just like ugly and then he made it into a whole thing.

527
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
It's so cool.

528
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:10,320
You know he's like a lyrical spiritual miracle guy.

529
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Yeah.

530
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,320
And the Ride and Dirty is like his only song that's like good and every other song is like

531
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,720
it's like he makes, it's like a song about him being like a medieval knight.

532
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,520
What was that?

533
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,000
It's just an ugly woman laughing.

534
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Yeah.

535
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Dude there was the other day.

536
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's like a witch.

537
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,240
(laughing)

538
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,280
- Don't fist bump me, that's scary.

539
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,080
I don't want a witch near my apartment.

540
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,920
- Why?

541
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,400
- The other day, I think it was going to your place,

542
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,680
but, oh, it was definitely your place.

543
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,540
You know how there's like the stairs you gotta walk down

544
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,760
to like get off the train?

545
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,040
- Oh, I thought you were talking about at my house.

546
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,440
- No, you know how your house has like stairs?

547
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,280
- Yeah.

548
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,620
- And like cabinets and like a sink?

549
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,280
But like there's the stairs you gotta walk down

550
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,800
the train station, there's like these like

551
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,560
Three like people just like sitting on the steps eating like slices of pizza and everyone was just like

552
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:11,700
Because there was like it was so congested because it was like probably five o'clock people were coming home from work

553
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,760
and these kids are like standing like

554
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,560
Turning to everybody in just like just go around

555
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,360
and like for

556
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,760
It took me like probably like two minutes to get off the stairs because these fucking people would just like we're just sitting there eating pizza

557
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,760
and then like anytime somebody told them to move,

558
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,100
they called them gay.

559
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,940
- That's cool.

560
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,080
- It was sick. - That's pretty sick.

561
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,920
- Yeah.

562
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,020
- I miss being a bad boy kid.

563
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,860
I was never that cool.

564
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,480
- Oh, dude, being a little piece of shit?

565
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,420
- I would just like,

566
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,840
I only felt good about shitting on an adult

567
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,200
when it was like six versus one.

568
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,680
So like even if you tried to fight me--

569
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,600
- Getting kicked out by a security guard somewhere.

570
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,280
- Like we can still overpower you.

571
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,760
Security guard doesn't have anything on him.

572
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,600
- Yeah.

573
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,920
But if it's like an older woman who works in an office

574
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,280
and is telling you to stop skating

575
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,840
inside of the office. That's what we used to do. You flip her off. Yeah. I didn't see a

576
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,440
sign that says no skateboarding. I'd flip her off the roof. That's what we did.

577
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:11,480
That's right. Do a tabletop. Yeah. Fucking kill her. You're not supposed to be on my roof. That's right.

578
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,760
It's her fucking bloody battered body at the bottom of the barrel and I'm a

579
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:23,400
stupid big bald bitch. Bulbous ass. Yeah with a butt. I sure as hell had a big ass.

580
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,600
Did you guys hear that two monkeys killed 200 dogs by flipping them off of tall buildings

581
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,600
and towers?

582
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
I literally did hear that.

583
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
I told you, I already heard that.

584
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Yeah.

585
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,400
There's a monkey attack on dogs in a village.

586
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Basically dogs killed a monkey baby and the monkeys took revenge by throwing 200 dogs

587
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,240
off of towers in a village.

588
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Swear to God.

589
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,200
It wasn't any of our dogs, right?

590
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
Yeah.

591
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Well, it was here.

592
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,640
It was, they were throwing them off of the Empire State Building.

593
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
No.

594
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
Yeah.

595
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Yeah.

fucking truck full of monkeys that the doesn't Philly though but they could

598
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:12,480
New York City there's so many towers here I were a monkey and I were in a war

599
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,200
against dogs I would move to New York it is funny that if you're a monkey if a

600
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,760
monkey lived in New York City it would just be spider-man yeah all the dogs

601
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,320
dogs here are the perfect size to be thrown off a tower. All the dogs in

602
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,240
Manhattan are bred with some kind of poodle. They're all different. Yeah,

603
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,660
exactly breeds. So like I was a monkey soldier if like you know like instead of

609
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,820
There was a--

610
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:54,960
- I fuckin' hate, I used to love, I hate monkeys now.

611
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,800
- Yeah.

612
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,900

614
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,460
- Fuck monkeys, man.

615
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,180
- Like I saw a video of a spider monkey in a house

616
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,580
and saw that it like tipped over

617
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,420
like somebody's like medicine cabinet.

618
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,100
- I especially hate the little ones.

619
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,940
- Yeah, I really--

620
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,140
- The little ones love mischief, man.

621
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,340
- I like monkeys still.

622
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,700
- They fuckin' steal people's hats

623
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,540
and they waddle away in their fuckin'

624
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:19,340
stupid little diaper. I told you about that neighbor I have with a monkey.

625
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,900
No I've definitely I've talked about that before.

626
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,500
Yeah the diapered monkey. Speak on it. There was a diapered monkey that lived

627
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,380
next to me and the monkey had to gamble for its food on a slot machine. You did

628
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,700
you yeah see I knew about this and Pat was the one who didn't. He asked Caleb to

629
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,660
tell it and then he took out his phone. You dropped me a photo. Yeah I was opening

630
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,580
the photo. 15 minutes ago. Well I got a notification for it now. You're just a

631
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,160
liar now. Yeah. I can show you the photo. You belong to the monkeys. I know what the

632
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:50,140
photo is. I airdropped it to you. Okay. Do you guys think that if you went into the

633
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,680
jungle and met a bunch like a huge village of... A talking monkey? A community? No, not even

634
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:00,060
talking monkeys. Do you think that if you were if you fell out of a plane right

635
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,800
and you were you were broken and you were cold and you were naked and

636
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,820
a group of kind or not even kind of monkeys if a group of monkeys found you

637
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:14,280
Would they recognize you as as they would eat you you think they'd eat you they eat other monkeys

638
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,800
I think I think some people might be chosen by monkeys to be

639
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,140
You see the hair on my body. They'd be like you could pass as a

640
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,440
Monkey, yeah, if you're strong if you're strong and you throw one of them against a tree or something

641
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,320
They'll have to establish dominance. Yeah. Yeah, but like they will they'll just eat you otherwise, but not I'm not talking chimps. I'm like, yeah

642
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,120
Little monkeys won't eat you.

643
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,620
It will.

644
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,000
No they don't, they eat fucking fruits.

645
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,340
A spider monkey will bite you.

646
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,420
I know, damn apple.

647
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,420
They're omnivores, dude.

648
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,040
They eat like little bugs and stuff.

649
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,380
They're eumnovores, they ain't mean-ivores.

650
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,260
Okay, they're gonna eat your fucking lame ass.

651
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,060
They're eating you for sure, dude.

652
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,260
Nah, I don't eat enough sugar to be sweet.

653
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,100
No.

654
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,140
I'm sour.

655
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,180
You would honestly...

656
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,860
They literally think your head is an apple

657
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,680
and they would try and eat it.

658
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,100
They would eat Patrick's body

659
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,780
and like their hearts would explode from caffeine.

660
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,060
It's like feeding a seagull Alka-Seltzer.

661
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,380
You know those videos of when like somebody like in like India or something

662
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,900
they like put down a box full of food and all the monkeys like swarm it?

663
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,300
That's what it would be on Patrick's body.

664
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,500
Could you imagine pulling off one single hair?

665
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,740
Things are switched like we have like India's monkey problem.

666
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,820
And what problem do they have?

667
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:28,500
I mean like monkeys are pests there.

668
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:28,980
Yeah.

669
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,380
Yeah.

670
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,180
Yeah dude.

671
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,980
Of course I would hope they're pests if they're throwing dogs off of towers.

672
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,180
Yeah, that's more like villains. Yeah, that's true. That's like monsters. We don't even know we don't have villains like

673
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:47,480
Those are pet a rat has never thrown an animal

674
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:54,680
Taking the trash out at night and you just see like like ten raccoons and like a thing imagine that but it's just monkeys

675
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,860
Yeah, yeah, I think about so scary. Yeah, they're too smart is the thing. Yeah, and they have human bodies

676
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,460
Yeah, what am I supposed to do? There's this one like I think I was

677
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,860

00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,140
that's like in your apartment yeah monkey living in your wall you'd like

682
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,900

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:39,300
Monkey.

686
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,800
Yeah, they're also there's more like if you have a rat in your

687
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,300
wall, it'll eat like your drywall or something, but a monkey

688
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,300
smart enough that it knows what is good that what you like and

689
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
it will eat that stuff.

690
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,200
Yeah, like a rat won't like eat your like favorite snack, but

691
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,000
a monkey will be lying to your favorite snack.

692
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,900
Yeah, because it's also its favorite snack.

693
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,300
A monkey is going to put like waffle crisp you bought in bulk

694
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,000
on Amazon.

695
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
The monkey exactly.

696
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,900
It's going to put monkey dress.

697
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,820
- A monkey dresses up like you,

698
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,220
goes to the door, takes the package,

699
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,260
and then you come home and all of your

700
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,700
waffle crisp is eaten by this monkey in a suit.

701
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,900
- We designed the stuff that we like to look cool,

702
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,620
and monkeys have the same brains as us,

703
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,540
so they also think the same stuff is cool.

704
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,380
- It's true.

705
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,220
- So they're gonna come in,

706
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,900
they're gonna just steal your PlayStation controllers

707
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,740
and run away.

708
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,580
- They literally will.

709
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,400
- It's like their brain looks at it,

710
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,700
and like this is a fun thing.

711
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,380
- The monkey touches my Switch,

712
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,740
deletes my save game.

713
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,580
- I'm gonna walk in,

714
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,440
- A monkey's gonna have my Oculus Quest

715
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,620
on playing Hitman 3 in virtual reality.

716
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,700
- Exactly, a rat comes into my house,

717
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
it's gonna try and steal my trash,

718
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,020
you stupid fucking idiot, I don't care about that.

719
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,860
I'm gonna get rid of that.

720
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,140
- Hey, newsflash, I hate the trash.

721
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,300
(laughing)

722
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,580
I hate trash, eat all you want, you fucking idiot.

723
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,220
- You can have that, check this out, it's a banana peel.

724
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,940
- Monkey's gonna take the trash can.

725
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,780
- That's when we have a problem.

726
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,980
- Hey, I actually seriously need that monkey.

727
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,220
- I know it's shiny monkey.

728
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,660

00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,020
been afraid of like not touch a monkey but it been afraid to eat around monkeys

741
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,700
since I saw us Moses Jones as a kid because I like oh yeah he tries to take

744
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,860
it is it supposed to be now it's a it's Moses Jones is about a oh I didn't even

745
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,540
think about that it kind of is yep well I know Forrest Gump is about a he shares

746
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:34,420
his egg for a month it's not about AIDS it's about not eating food off he takes

747
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:40,260
a monkey's egg that is him yes he's like well no the monkey takes his egg well I

748
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:45,180
mean we don't know what happens think about the monkey yeah they share an egg

749
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:52,140
together yeah they share a beautiful they cohabitate yeah Bill Murray fucks a

750
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,480
chimp yeah yeah osmosis Jones is a scary looking

751
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,440
Eric punishes have you seen what he looks like when he smiles as Moses Jones

752
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,340
cool is the scariest smile of any like good guy animated character it's so

753
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,180
sick I've rewatched osmosis Jones recently such a good movie man the

754
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,260
animation it's so scary when he slices the guys in half they turn to go do when

755
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,740
he has his his hot finger and he's like cutting through stuff. The hot finger is

756
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:24,020
like one of the ultimate villains. That is the coolest. So first of all this is what

757
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,940
Osmosis Jones looks like when he smiles. That's just his normal smile. He looks

758
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,980
like he does that when he's like hey guys nice to see you and he does that

759
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,540
smile. He looks evil as hell. It's good. Is Osmosis Jones about AIDS? When I

760
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:42,300
rewatched Osmosis Jones like a year ago, maybe less, and I was watching it with Anna

761
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,140
and I was like yeah the bad guy get the bag guy so cool his name is strep finger

762
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:53,620
believed in my head that his name was something I made up in my head as a kid

763
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,380
when I watched it no wait like they're gonna call him strep think like he

764
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,700
showed up and they didn't call him stripping or like they'll call him that

765
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:06,620
later his name's supposed to be racks strip is that movie about the anthrax

766
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:10,740
scares what does his name's tracks it's like tracks a mundar what are you

767
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:16,640
fucking talking about Thrax and virus yeah yeah it is made out of spores it's a

768
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,160
poison poison virus doesn't have spores I did not get a good grade in my plagues

769
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,480
class you thought they you thought it's about a monkey that puts anthrax on in

770
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,180
the mail and then gives it to Bill Murray somebody at NBC when they did the anthrax

771
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,200
scares was like we're gonna make this movie yeah but it's gonna be a monkey in

772
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,400
an egg now. What came first? You honestly asked the question. What came first, the

773
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,360
monkey or the egg? It's a good question. But yeah, I was so mad that it

774
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:50,480
wasn't named Strip Finger. I felt like that's like a way better name. It's a

775
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:58,800
cool name. I googled it and it's just nothing. If I caught Strip Finger, I'd be

776
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,160
"ooh". You better catch this Strip Finger. That's right. Right up in your fucking...

777
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,160
Hmm?

778
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Right up in your--

779
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,160
And do kids in a sandbox?

780
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,160
Is that what we're gonna do?

781
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,560
Doing it in your dookie shoot.

782
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
Oh, okay.

783
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Yeah.

784
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,000
I was thinking of the front hole.

785
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Nope.

786
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Nope.

787
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Nope.

788
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,000
That's nasty.

789
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Sounded by a finger.

790
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
That's nasty.

791
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,960
You're gonna hear the sound of this finger going up your doo-doo surprise.

792
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Yeah.

793
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
Finger in the dinger.

794
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,400
Well, there, I mean, I would not do it today.

795
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,160
Today is especially good for me because of all the dookie in your butt that I wanna fucking

796
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
feel around.

797
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,920
I was gonna save it up.

798
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,920
No.

799
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,580
out my window. I don't want one, I don't want a giant. Because we were in LA like

800
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,080
two weeks ago I'm still thinking of like remembering the you tell me the story

801
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,680
about the lady getting a cup of diarrhea thrown at her. Oh yeah, that's a great

802
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,840
story. That is the most evil man. I probably told that to eight people while we were in LA.

803
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,960
Yeah, they were like hey you lived here for a minute why'd you move and I was

804
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,200
like there's a lot of things but one thing is a lady got hot diarrhea and

805
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,260
then somebody told me I told him that story and they were like I actually saw

806
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,500
that on the news and it wasn't hot diarrhea in a cup, it was hot diarrhea in a bucket.

807
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,540
Yeah, it was a bucket.

808
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,020
Okay.

809
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,620
Yeah, it always was a bucket. I think when we originally talked about it.

810
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,740
That's the rarest kind of story of like telephone where it actually gets less,

811
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,660
there's less diarrhea.

812
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,380
Yeah, no, I remember it being a bucket.

813
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,860
It was actually way more diarrhea than I even thought.

814
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,340
Yeah.

815
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,860
We want to soften the blow.

816
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,060
Because the bucket, so it's already...

817
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,420
If I was that lady, I'd tell everybody it was a cup, not a bucket.

818
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:33,020
It's already premeditated, but if I was 40% crazier, I could imagine myself finishing

819
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,460
a large sweet tea from McDonald's and then saying I'm gonna diarrhea in this

820
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:42,920
yeah but to go and get a bucket yeah and diarrhea in the bucket and then put it

821
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:47,780
on a woman's head also you have to walk around with the bucket of diarrhea like

822
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,500
Kevin from The Office we just look I mean just pretend as your business goddess

823
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,220
it's got to stay hot so you got it exactly you're holding it with you're

824
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,860
holding it with pot holders, you're walking around with the bucket of diarrhea.

825
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Just whistling, skipping your loo.

826
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Keep the lid on so it doesn't...

827
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,580
I think maybe he was going to a diarrhea pot look and had an accident.

828
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,660
He might have been going to a diarrhea cook-off. That's a really good point.

829
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,220
And then he spilled it.

830
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Eddie's million dollar diarrhea cook-off.

831
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Do you think it was hot because it was fresh or do you think he heated it up?

832
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Well it's not because of the damn LA sun and climate change.

833
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
I think it was night time probably.

834
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:25,700
it up, well it's got to be nighttime because you're smelling the

835
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,140
diarrhea and looking around saying which direction is that coming from. If it's

836
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,980
daytime you're identifying the threat immediately. If it's nighttime it's

837
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,340
a little bit harder. Yeah exactly. So I think yeah no this guy this guy really

838
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,340
planned it out and I think he had to have heated up the diarrhea because if

839
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:45,780
there's enough diarrhea to fill up a bucket. Yeah exactly. It can't be that fresh.

840
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,260
But it might have been like you know when you're sometimes you're in a bath the

841
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,820
bath gets a little cold you add just a little bit of really hot water so maybe

842
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:55,300
Maybe the diarrhea got cold and he spurted out an especially hot one.

843
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,300
Yeah.

844
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,820
Just to like kind of temper the entire thing a little bit.

845
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,820
Yeah.

846
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,820
That's a good.

847
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:01,820
Does that make some sense?

848
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,820
That makes a lot of sense to me.

849
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,820
Thank you.

850
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:04,820
Yeah.

851
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,820
You're welcome.

852
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,540
But yeah, I think that is one of the coolest things I've ever had.

853
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Yeah.

854
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,340
He could also have had, it could have been like, you know, a tin bucket, like a classic

855
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:18,420
bucket and he has a set up kind of like a witch and he kind of has a cauldron type set

856
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,700
up with a fire and a big stick and he's stirring it.

857
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:26,340
bucket that goes on two burners that like that Cajun chef guy uses? Stale Cracker?

858
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:30,660
I only know about witches. Oh yeah. You ever seen that guy, Stale Cracker? No I've seen a witch.

859
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:36,820
He's great. I only know like porn stuff. Stale Cracker is a guy that's like he makes like the

860
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:42,180
big-ass like gumbo pots and stuff. Oh he pours orange juice and shit into it? Yeah. Why'd he be

861
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,980
pouring that orange juice? Oh I don't think it's that guy. Stale Cracker is the guy that's like

862
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,160
"We're gonna put on a cracker, dude."

863
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,160
He sounds Cajun.

864
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,160
He's got like a big, yeah, he's making gumbo.

865
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Oh, really? He sounds seriously Cajun.

866
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,160
I was watching a video of him earlier where he's like, "Today I'm gonna learn you how to make deer lollipops."

867
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,160
Deer lollipops.

868
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,160
Deer? Deer meat lollipops.

869
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,220
- That's hot. - Okay, popsicles or lollipops?

870
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,620
- Dear meat popsicles. - 'Cause a lollipop is not cold.

871
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,220
- Yeah, that's frozen beef jerky.

872
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:25,220
- That's just, oh, dear lollipop is just meat on a stick.

873
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,060
- Yeah, it's just the rib bone.

874
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,660
- And so is a popsicle, it's just cold meat on a stick.

875
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,860
- It's the rib bone cooked with a little bit--

876
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,380
- A dear lollipop is so much more gross

877
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,420
than a dear popsicle. - Yeah, it's just hot.

878
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,820
- Yeah, 'cause a lollipop is hot.

879
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,140
It's a good point. - What if they gave you

880
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,180
a bunch of-- - What is the Cajun two-step?

881
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,880
- What if they gave you just meat at the bank

882
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,620
instead of lollipops for the price of that?

883
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:47,740
- Yeah, the meat bank?

884
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:48,580
- No, not the meat bank.

885
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:49,620
- No, like as a treat.

886
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,820
- Oh, like you get a Slim Jim instead of a--

887
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,660
- Yeah.

888
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,500
(laughing)

889
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,320
- Like instead of a--

890
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,160
- I feel like I would much rather,

891
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,500
I would start going to the bank

892
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:58,720
and I would start getting money.

893
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,260
- Yeah, I would deposit and withdraw like--

894
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,620
- Yeah, why don't we just go to the bank every day

895
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,060
and withdraw and deposit and just get a free lollipop.

896
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,460
- Just get free lollipops and then start a lollipop business.

897
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,800
and then start selling the lollipops.

898
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
- It's always, you're always gonna make a profit.

899
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,700
- Plus it's dumb dumb mystery flavor.

900
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,000
What the hell kind of flavor is that?

901
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,840
- We're working, yeah.

902
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,500
I mean, with the money I make from my lollipop business,

903
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,540
I'm gonna be funding a research study.

904
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,380
- Yeah, I got a couple scientists.

905
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,940
- Huge research team into the flavor of the mystery flavor.

906
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,800
- Well, the thing is, well, here's the secret

907
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,820
about the mystery flavor.

908
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,060
- What is it?

909
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,340
- It's different every time.

910
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,780
- It's always strawberry.

911
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,880
- It's different every time.

912
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,720
- What does that mean?

913
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,540
- That would be, they could just do,

914
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,720
they could, it would take a while for people to catch on

915
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,040
if they're just like, just did only strawberry

916
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,080
and just put the mystery,

917
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,120
you can't tell what it tastes like

918
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,800
without the wrapper color.

919
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,120
- I wonder how they get the,

920
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,480
oh, do you know that,

921
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,280
I wonder how they get a wrapper that doesn't say a flavor.

922
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,080
(laughing)

923
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,920
Where do they find those?

924
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,000
- How do you get those question mark wrappers?

925
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,280
- And how do they get the question mark onto the wrapper?

926
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,120
- That's a really good point.

927
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,000
- You know if you save the-- - Pencil or crayon or--

928
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,480
- If you save the wrappers,

929
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,920
if you, it used to be you could send them in

930
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,000
and get like a t-shirt.

931
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,200
- I'd like to save the wrappers

932
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,440
from these pressed fentanyl Xanax pills.

933
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,480
- Yeah, I'm not saving any of them.

934
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,540
- I'd like to save every last one of them.

935
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:20,400
- Maybe if instead of doing Xanax,

936
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,880
we replace it with lollipops.

937
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,760
- A little peep would be alive, man.

938
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,840
He'd still be, he'd be singing his little

939
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,560
fucking heart out every day.

940
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,280
- Yeah, I mean if he knew the wonders of Mr. Dum-Dum.

941
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,000
- I would love to have him taxidermied

942
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,920
and set up like right in that corner right there.

943
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,920
That'd be awesome.

944
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:41,560
And he's doing a bear pose and be like, "Oh, he almost got me."

945
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,560
"He almost got me.

946
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,240
Luckily, I popped a Fiddle pillow in his mouth with a dart gun."

947
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Thank God, dude.

948
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,960
Just him, you're just like dressing him up.

949
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,160
You're using him to play in your outfit for the day.

950
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,160
He's my coat hook.

951
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,160
He has his own map.

952
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,160
Yeah, exactly.

953
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Yeah.

954
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
That'd be so hard.

955
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
That'd be sick, dude.

956
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
Well, not Lil Peep.

957
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
Are you kidding?

958
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
That's Lil Peep.

959
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,360
Well, I mean, just like a taxidermied thing that holds your clothes.

960
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,520
I want to have little people is going to be like you know that they would they put

961
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,000
outside of pizza places the little pizza guy statue he's gonna be that for my for

962
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,560
my bedroom check out this place is that little peeps dead thing out holding out

963
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:27,960
a plastic plate of spaghetti he has a long twirly mustache yeah you know

964
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,280
that's mostly a north end thing you see that mostly there's a north end in

965
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,480
Boston has the same yeah yeah in chef yeah yeah that dude every restaurant

966
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
with the big black mustache.

967
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,360
I think if I make a lot of money, I'm gonna buy the corpses of every rapper and I'm gonna

968
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,680
make a merry-go-round with them where you ride on them.

969
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,680
Oh that'd be cool.

970
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,680
Yeah.

971
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,680
Like House of Wax.

972
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,480
Yeah, like House of Wax, except you ride on them like horsies.

973
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,280
Yeah, that'd be really fucking cool.

974
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,920
And I could make really rich, fucked up guys pay money to do that.

975
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
I think that might be illegal.

976
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,920
Do you ever see the pirate that they put in restaurants?

977
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
No.

978
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
No.

979
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,160
There's a, okay maybe it was just in my hometown, but there was a pirate that they had, it's

980
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,440
like a big like pirate statue.

981
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,320
There's two or three different restaurants all had the same pirate.

982
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,360
None of these restaurants were pirate themed.

983
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,360
I think it was one of the-

984
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,360
I think you've seen a ghost.

985
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:21,440
There was this diner my mom used to work at that had a pirate in the lobby.

986
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,880
Have you ever seen this-

987
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,640
And then there was a different pizza place that had the pirate.

988
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,320
This red and white stick statue they have in front of all these barber shops in my hometown.

989
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
I've seen that.

990
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:34,320
Also, they have a different red and white stick when Santa comes.

991
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,320
Yeah, that's true.

992
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,000
It's kind of interesting.

993
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,560
I hear it's the same one, but it's a seasonal.

994
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,880
Were you mad as a kid when you found out that that barber pole didn't taste like candy?

995
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,880
Yeah.

996
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
Yeah, I think so.

997
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,880
I was really mad.

998
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,320
Yeah, I got really, really mad.

999
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,160
I killed the barber.

1000
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:59,760
When I lived in Boston, near Coolidge Corner, there was some apartment building that had

1001
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,800
a fake like a butler statue in the lobby and it was like I don't know if it was

1002
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,920
like a Halloween decoration that just left out or not because it like was like

1003
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,760
it like held out a bowl, but it didn't look like like Halloween. It was just

1004
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,560
like a butler that held out a bowl with something for swing, but it would

1005
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,560
literally it would startle me every time I walked by because it's just like a

1006
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:22,800
like it was like like the guy you're talking about holding out a boy. I would

1007
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,520
all I would always be walking by at night and like everything would be dark

1008
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,240
except that like the lobby would have all the lights on it would just be like a

1009
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:32,560
got like a hunched over butler guy looking at me. That's a seriously bad gig. Yeah.

1010
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:39,020
Yeah, just you know. I want one bad. Oh, I want a butler to torture. You want to torture the

1011
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:45,260
butler? You want a butt butler. Oh, so paying somebody to serve your turds. You

1012
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:53,520
want a, you want to, you want a Hutler. Hutler. Above Hutler.

1013
00:48:53,520 --> 00:49:01,920
Yeah, you want that guy. Yeah. Yeah, I want it so I can throw him off my balcony.

1014
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,720
No, you want to get Adolf Hitler to be your butler.

1015
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,720
Off my penthouse balcony when I'm rich as fuck.

1016
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:07,720
No, you wouldn't be.

1017
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,720
I buy Hitler's bones when I'm rich as fuck and I keep them skeletonized in a glass case.

1018
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
But not the real Hitler's bones.

1019
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,720
I buy all of Hitler's real bones.

1020
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:24,720
if I had a million dollars I'd buy Hitler's bones.

1021
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,720
It's the first verse of that song.

1022
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,720
If I had a million dollars, I'd buy Hitler's bones.

1023
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,720
It's just all about buying Hitler's shit.

1024
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:50,820
If I had a million dollars, I'd buy Hitler cyanide tooth. If I had a

1025
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,400
million dollars, I would buy you blondies ball.

1026
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,600
These ball

1027
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,740
I would get I would buy Hitler's bones and I would keep them all in separate

1028
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,100
room, so they could never reassemble and become an evil skeleton. As far as

1029
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:07,960
dry Hitler

1030
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,820
you're clink clink clink.

1031
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
- Yeah.

1032
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,300
- Oh great, I got to go go-cart racing for some reason.

1033
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,780
- I have to ground pound him again.

1034
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:17,780
- Yeah.

1035
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,540
- Take another few years to reform.

1036
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:21,540
- Taylor was in front of me, bro.

1037
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,540
He's catching a blue shell to the back of the head.

1038
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:24,540
- Oh, dude.

1039
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,540
- Absolutely.

1040
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:26,540
- You think Taylor's in first place?

1041
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,540
- If he is.

1042
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:31,980
- No, but if he would, I'd kill him with my blue shell.

1043
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,980
- You see.

1044
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,060
- And I might do some mushrooms and get even speedier than him, so.

1045
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,060
- I finally found that video.

1046
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,340
- Guess who's the racist Nazi now, Mr. Nazi you?

1047
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,940
I finally found that video of the guy where he's like cooking the fruitcake in the microwave

1048
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:47,940
and he's like "I used to look up to Hitler!"

1049
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:48,940
What?

1050
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:49,940
Oh you didn't see that?

1051
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,940
No.

1052
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,260
Oh it's so good.

1053
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,340
He's making like a 75,000 calorie fruitcake in his microwave.

1054
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,780
You've been sitting around googling fruity Hitler videos?

1055
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:07,260
I looked up Hitler microwave until I found it.

1056
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,900
You're being a bit suspicious to me.

1057
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:16,980
You're being sus. You have imposter vibes. I do. I'm sussy as hell. You're acting like

1058
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,420
Renuder. Nah, don't you dare. You are being a complete Renuder.

1059
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:30,420
I learned a little German, let's see, it's being Kali Muscle.

1060
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,420
Yeah, that's good.

1061
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,420
It's Kali Muscle?

1062
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,420
That's pretty good, huh?

1063
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,420
Oh, I know Kali Muscle.

1064
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,420
I looked up to, I ain't gonna lie to you, bro, this is how I got, I was too, I looked up to

1065
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:40,420
Hitler, man.

1066
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:46,420
I know a lot of y'all might say that's weird, but you know, me being a leader and a killer,

1067
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,420
like, you know, we admire other leaders and killers.

1068
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,420
You know what I mean?

1069
00:51:51,420 --> 00:52:16,420
I'm

1070
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,660
Are you driving a Mercedes Benz?

1071
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,660
Are you got guns?

1072
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,100
40 cows, SK, all that?

1073
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,100
You admire Hitler, man?

1074
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,100
I'm just saying.

1075
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,100
I'm just saying, bro.

1076
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,100
Whoa.

1077
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,100
That is sick, dude.

1078
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:38,780
To be like a on my grind Instagram business post guy and be like, "Listen, say what you

1079
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,380
want about Hitler."

1080
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,220
He was a leader and he was a killer.

1081
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,420
He said that he invented Uzi's.

1082
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,420
Those are Israeli guns.

1083
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,420
He invented the Uzi, he invented Mercedes-Benz.

1084
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,420
He invented the Uzi?

1085
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,420
Yeah, Uzi was the one that was wrong, the only one.

1086
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,420
Yeah, he invented all the others.

1087
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:56,420
Everything else though.

1088
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,420
Everything else Hitler invented.

1089
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,420
Yeah, he says he praises him because he invented steroids.

1090
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,420
[Laughter]

1091
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:04,420
He said it, methamphetamine dude.

1092
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:08,420
If you like meth, you have to give your Hitler fam.

1093
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,420
I mean, you go to Huntington Beach, that's not a problem.

1094
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,420
There's a lot of meth heads who love Hitler.

1095
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:17,260
I mean y'all have been talking about you know Adderall. Seriously like you guys

1096
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:21,420
are kind of my proxy. Y'all are like y'all have done a lot for Hitler's image.

1097
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:30,580
Crap. This episode has. No you guys have. No I haven't. Hey I I've done a lot for Hitler's image. I

1098
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,540
printed out and put it up at the shooting range and shot my damn gun at

1099
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:38,900
it a thousand times. It is funny to be to be have like a six-year-old kid and take

1100
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,840
him to the doctor and the doctor's like well he's a little energetic so I'm

1101
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:44,840
I'm gonna give him the same drugs that Hitler loved to do all the time.

1102
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,840
(laughter)

1103
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:49,840
It's basically an Omega Mac, exactly like Hitler.

1104
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,840
That's why I can't think.

1105
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:53,840
Because you're stupid as Hitler was.

1106
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,840
Yeah. He was dumb as hell.

1107
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,840
Yep. He was choogy.

1108
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,840
Yeah, he was kind of normie.

1109
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,840
Hitler was choogy as hell.

1110
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,840
If you saw Hitler in Dime Square being a choogy normie, what would you do, honestly?

1111
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,840
I'd probably say fuck vibes.

1112
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,840
Yeah, I'd say the vibes are off here.

1113
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:16,680
Yeah, yeah, I'd say you have zero swag stay out of my imagine. Okay, you get out you

1114
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,760
walk out of the bathroom at Klando. Uh-huh. Look who's sitting in the corner.

1115
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,640
Adolf Hitler. Yeah, I'd probably I'd probably post on my I probably post on my

1116
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,080
Klando. I probably I'd probably post on my Instagram close friend stories some

1117
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,640
people really walking around Klando like the Hitler and then I probably delete it

1118
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,360
after five minutes. And then say sorry about that last post. Yeah. That last

1119
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,360
story was the vibes were the vibes were f'd in that one.

1120
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,200
That was a little chewy of me. What if you yeah but what if you get out of the

1121
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,240
bathroom you find out he's in the corner you're like ah great Hitler's here then

1122
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:55,120
you find out while you were in the bathroom he put his debit card down he

1123
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,640
said for the next hour all drinks are on me. That's fine I'm taking his money

1124
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,840
away from him. Yeah it's it's yeah Adolf Hitler? I'm bleeding him dry. Yeah that's

00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,160
good yeah. I'll have 17 Long Island iced teas. Wait it's not like you're buying

1126
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,160
It's not like you're buying-

1127
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,960
Four Long Island Iced Teas, me with my arm around it.

1128
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:18,880
You know what man, you're like a pretty funny and a bust of Mercedes Benz is the fastest

1129
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,880
car I've ever-

1130
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:20,880
Yeah.

1131
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,880
I'm putting my debit card down.

1132
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,880
Anything you want.

1133
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
Anything you want.

1134
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,880
Anything you want.

1135
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
Anything you want.

1136
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:28,880
Rest of the night is on me.

1137
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Okay?

1138
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,880
You know where we can get some-

1139
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:31,880
Yeah.

1140
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,160
Cause you know he would have the connect.

1141
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,160
Oh yeah.

1142
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:42,560
seriously. Hitler would have that, he'd get you a blow up from the flow up. You guys

1143
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,240
would be walking around like the messed up versions of Cheech and Chong, just having

1144
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,000
all the fun in the world. And you'd be singing, you'd be singing that Mexican

1145
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,320
American songs but it'd have a different perspective. It'd have a way worse

1146
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,640
perspective. Argentinian American songs.

1147
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:08,080
be crushing it. Argentinian Germans are named Helen and Olga and they have a son-in-law

1148
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:17,000
named Jose. Be awesome dude. Yeah. That Argentinian German song is gonna be great.

1149
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,680
It's gonna be huge for you. It's gonna be fire. Oh God. Argentinian America or fuck.

1150
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:26,860
Who's the new, who would you guys say is like the newest Hitler?

1151
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,860
Joe Biden.

1152
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,860
Hillary damn Clinton.

1153
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,860
Joe Biden I said first.

1154
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,180
So you guys saying it's a tie between Joe, I would like to say.

1155
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,740
I don't think it's a tie, I think it's just Joe Biden.

1156
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:37,500
Okay can I submit maybe Dr. Fakie himself?

1157
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,500
Oh definitely.

1158
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
Dr. Fakie?

1159
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,500
Dr. Fakie's more like a Mongola.

1160
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:43,500
True.

1161
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,500
A Mongolas?

1162
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:45,500
A Mongola.

1163
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,500
I'd like to Mangle him.

1164
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,500
He's like a Mongolas, he's such a sell.

1165
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,500
Yup.

1166
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,500
That's true.

1167
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,900
- Yeah, that's a fact.

1168
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,140
- And that's a t-shirt we're making.

1169
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:56,060
- Or maybe LeBron, LeChina.

1170
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:56,900
- LeChina. - He could be seen

1171
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:59,180
as a Hitler figure. - True, LeChina shames.

1172
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,260
- Who do you guys honestly think

1173
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:03,020
might end up being the Antichrist?

1174
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,500
I've been feeling like the Antichrist

1175
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,660
has come up for many years. - Oh yeah, no, it's like,

1176
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
what, say like six years, seven years?

1177
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:09,060
- Seven year tribulation. - Yeah, seven year

1178
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,060
tribulation. - So first of all,

1179
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,420
we already have the microchip in our,

1180
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:16,340
it says the left arm is where the microchip is gonna go,

1181
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:18,300
the mark of the beast.

1182
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,940
- Mark of the beast. - I got it.

1183
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,660
you know so according to a screenshot on my phone.

1184
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:24,660
So like I...

1185
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:25,660
Something pointy.

1186
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,780
Yeah, something pointy is going to put a mark of the beast in your body.

1187
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,020
So now I think...

1188
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:31,220
We can't say what.

1189
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,580
Something pointy and sharp.

1190
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:36,580
And vaccine-ish.

1191
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,180
Yeah, rhymes with Maxine.

1192
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,180
Yeah.

1193
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:42,260
My favorite drug.

1194
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,740
And you're addicted to vaccines.

1195
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,740
Sorry mom.

1196
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:49,940
Yeah, but I think you get, I think it's one year, within one year of the mark of the beast

1197
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,480
the Antichrist shows up and then seven years of tribulation yeah I think are we

1198
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,520
in the tribulations now it could be like I don't think so cuz I nobody's been

1199
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,420
raptured yet true you gotta get rapture people get raptured all the good people

1200
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,460
get rapture so I'll probably we'll be recording you know when the rapture

1201
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:10,080
happened and nobody got taken yep damn not gonna happen though because of how

1202
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,340
good and Christian I think one day we're gonna be we're gonna be recording an

1203
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,160
episode right we're gonna be laughing about somebody got raptured what was your

1204
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:23,000
name? The one we've got Dookie on her head? No, never mind. Who are you talking about?

1205
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,200
I forgot her name. Who's? Is there a woman who famously flew up into the sky

1206
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:34,440
angelically? Who are you talking about? Who? Who's her? The lady that... What?

1207
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:42,960
Gabby Petito? She got raptured? No, maybe. That guy's innocent. Yeah, that could be true.

1208
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:47,480
you got raptured. Yeah, I guess you're right. But you guys are gonna be recording with me

1209
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,800
one day and we're gonna be talking about something and you guys are gonna say

1210
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,120
something really kind of off color. I think the queen of England might have got raptured. Oh my gosh!

1211
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:58,160
That might be true. Yeah, she was the only person who was as pure of spirit. If I got

1212
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,920
seriously left behind, I'm gonna be fucking mad. Yeah. But I yeah you guys are

1213
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,760

1214
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,440

1215
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,840
pants of thong yep it's not gonna be I I won't care I'm gonna be in the kingdom

1216
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:18,480
of heaven you guys have to suffer for seven years of war fall to the ground

1217
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,600
there's like a loud like client like what is that like oh it's like a chastity

1218
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:26,480
it would be funny when you got raptured because you don't need your dick and

1219
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,240
ball just leave them behind yeah oh yeah when you get to heaven you're playing

1220
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:35,200
down there I don't want it I don't want to have disgusting sex up there that's

1221
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,040
right my grandma's line is silk mm-hmm also you just become like a blanket or

1222
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:43,160
some shit you're not even a human anymore yeah you know once you get to heaven you

1223
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,120
become an angel and clear that I mean biblical angels don't look like people

1224
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:50,040
you know what I look like I'm like to Rubik's Cube yeah you become like two

1225
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:55,520
rings intertwined with an eyeball or like you know what form or like a

1226
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,840
yeah like a person with wings and a halo would probably be you I would become

1227
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:05,600
honestly like the the cherub one because it would be funny to prank people I

1228
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:10,440
would choose to look exactly like God that's not an option no you just asked

1229
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:14,640
me to pick my form you're in God's image right now

1230
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:19,360
that's like a new Lucifer thing that's literally what Lucifer wanted to do and that's why he fell

1231
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,840
that's literally why he fell from the kingdom of heaven. He looks like

1232
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:28,480
bizarro Jesus with that damn hair look at that look at that boy yep mm-hmm so

1233
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,180
you think it's wrong to want to be just like God. He's trying. Oh my God, you're

1234
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,380
trying to become the Antichrist right now aren't you? He's been trying all

1235
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:42,100
along. Are you fucking kidding me? This is what you're choosing to do? Is become the

1236
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:47,060
Antichrist? No. His voice has gotten a lot deeper since we met him. That is actually

1237
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:52,120
true. Mm-hmm. And you walk it, look you're even, you're shoeless like Christ.

1238
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:57,580
You want me to bathe your feet? Yes. This is actually getting weird.

1239
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:03,220
yeah this is actually I'm starting to look at his hair uh-huh his is charming

1240
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,860
smile that could absolutely sway millions towards the followers he have

1241
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:14,140
billions he does have 12 I have 12 followers so that means I'm Jesus right

1242
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:18,900
so you're saying oh my god he's named you haven't named a single so either

1243
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:22,820
thing yeah so you could you could be the Jewish Messiah yeah I don't think you

1244
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:27,020
are they don't even they don't have one right yeah they say one's coming right I

1245
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:31,020
I don't, I don't, I literally, I met like my first Jewish person when I was 12.

1246
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,020
Okay.

1247
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,020
But you...

1248
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:34,420
That's, it's been a long time since then.

1249
01:01:34,420 --> 01:01:36,420
You have plenty of time to learn something about Judaism.

1250
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,420
I haven't met another one.

1251
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:38,420
I haven't met another one yet.

1252
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,420
That's not a good excuse.

1253
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,820
I moved here in the hopes that I would meet one, but no.

1254
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:45,820
Pretty hard to find around here.

1255
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,820
Yeah, it's not easy.

1256
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,820
No.

1257
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:50,160
It's way, I mean, New Hampshire, I was lucky to have one.

1258
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,360
But if you become the Antichrist, I will be pretty pissed.

1259
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,360
So I need you to...

1260
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,360
I need you to...

1261
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,980
I need you to drop your...

1262
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,860
- Hey, if you guys-- - Your global microphone.

1263
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,000
- If you guys help me--

1264
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,100
- Why would I help you? - Be Jesus.

1265
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:02,940
- Why would I help, you won't be,

1266
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:03,760
you can never become Jesus. - You guys don't wanna be

1267
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,420
my Jesus apostles?

1268
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:07,420
- Wait, what, you're gonna have two apostles?

1269
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:09,140
- Well, let's just start. - Or two at a time.

1270
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,180
- I thought you said I already had 12.

1271
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,460
- He has 12 followers. - You have 12 followers.

1272
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,660
- You have 12 followers.

1273
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,580
- Oh, okay. - Yeah.

1274
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,780
- My mistake. - Yeah.

1275
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,020
The apostles are way different.

1276
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,220
- Yeah, completely different. - 'Cause we have to,

1277
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:21,000
we have to write a psalm.

1278
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,060
- Oh, you do. - Really?

1279
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,580
- You do. - No, I mean, I guess.

1280
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,580
So do I have to though? You just said you did.

1281
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:31,180
Okay, what is your... Well, I mean, getting our own book of deals,

1282
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,700
that's going to be nice. That's a really good point. This actually

1283
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:38,420
might be pretty cool, but what are your tenets that you want to base your new world order

1284
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,540
on? I didn't see tenet.

1285
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,380
What are your rules that you want to base the world on? But you only get seven years

1286
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:46,140
of rule, by the way, until you have to be punished by God forever.

1287
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,380
That's fine. I mean, that's... Okay, so what are we doing in the seven years?

1288
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,740
Chill. Chilling is not very Antichrist of you.

1289
01:02:52,740 --> 01:02:56,660
about Barca I'm not the Antichrist hmm go to Barcade that could be pretty good

1290
01:02:56,660 --> 01:03:00,100
that's very sinful yeah that's but that's kind of like all the sins rolled

1291
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:04,220
into one mm-hmm could we indulge in wealth to my indulgence will be big
