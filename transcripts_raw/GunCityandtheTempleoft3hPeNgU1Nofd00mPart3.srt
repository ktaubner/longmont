[Dramatic music]

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,320
Last time on Gun City, the Temple of Tepenguin of Doom.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,800
Our three adventurers fought against two mysterious ninjas, whose dastardly ways and

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,000
skillful combat techniques nearly foiled our heroes, but they prevailed using the tried and

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,480
true tactics of shooting someone until they are dead. Ray William Johnson by happenstance

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,560
and wanton cruelty discovered that there were traitor Jollibees in the ranks of Leo's security

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,120
force and quickly dispatched one with a powerful matrix beam. Meanwhile Patrick Yoda used his force

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,400
abilities to obtain the floppy disk and played keep away with the ninjas. Blotoss Piss was the

9
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,960
the one who shot them all in the head. After the ninjas escaped using dark magics of some

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,580
kind, the team met up back at Leo's pad, where he entered the floppy disk into his ancient

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,540
Dale computer and revealed a webpage that led to the club Penguin Island, where the island's

12
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,620
location it was discovered by a crafty way William Johnson was reflected in both longitude

13
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:14,460
and latitude of the land caves in the outer zone of Gun City, called Scope Zone, just

14
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,860
beyond the invisible unfinished wall. These caves should hold the next clue to finding

15
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,060
the Temple of Tipanguin of Doom and the fabled N-Word Pass.

16
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:31,100
Our heroes took Sullivan and Leo Skygallion across the high seas known as The Air all the

17
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:37,740
way to Gadsville, a small city in the Scope Zone that has jurisdiction over the Land Caves.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,260
They arrived in Gadsville and immediately attacked some of the electrical wiring that

19
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,640
powers the city

20
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,040
afterwards they walked to the hotel that's what she said

21
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,700
when they made everyone who works there upset

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,220
and then finally went to their rooms

23
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,380
where they were quickly called down from

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,960
from the by a stranger super handsome

25
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,500
stranger v folk named beautiful simon who told them it was time to meet

26
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,680
with the cats

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,900
and so yeah that's what happened so

28
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,660
uh... i believe uh...

29
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,340
patrick

30
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,060
you know the screen

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,340
uh...

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,620
in excitement

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,500
and uh...

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,940
yet beautiful simons there they are just sort of floating like a

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,660

78
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,700

80
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,960
we partially invite you to visit the gas family in our

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
gateway cow

okay we partially invite you to

84
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,740
did i say visit we're going to give it a big uh... so it seems like

85
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,180
it seems like this recording is faulty so i'm not sure we should trust you

86
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:49,260
but since you can't even simply replay

87
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,420
over again

88
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:54,520
you might be the dumbest guy i've ever met and there's just a name bullshit

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,840
over and over again

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,760
but the business uh...

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,760
i can't stress enough that i'm showing you a hologram

92
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,600

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,860
there's room for

182
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,620
helipads for different like you know air travel for people to land

183
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,460
is probably near the area where you would have landed your sky galleon

184
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,140
uh... and you see

185
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,820
the massive cow

186
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,440

not to do that

211
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,840

221
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,640

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,280
yeah i know it's good it's it's loud it's sort of uh... it doesn't sting your ass

223
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,880
you know as far as where it's like

224
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,960
and it's not like you

225
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,800
kind of

226
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,920
does it keep up something yet not like that at all it's a good news

227
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,920
again

228
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,580
and you see you see it it just it's you see solving just like trying

229
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,800
not to vomit

230
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,280
is it's a stinky

231
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,040
i'm sitting on a cloud of i mean i don't know how it comes out of

232
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,320
of caleb's ass and it just this flies right to sullivan and just

233
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,320
and just stays

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
he's like a person

235
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,520
sullivan's like running in circles and the clouds just following him

236
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,520
like oh not again

237
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,320
yeah you guys get to the hoof

238
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,520
beautiful simon sort of teleports out of the or phases out of the giant cart

239
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,080
giant walmart cart and you all sort of pile into this

240
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,380
this metal ramp onto it looks like an elevator beautiful Simon once again,

241
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,280
like phases into the like elevator like control panel and it starts to take you

242
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,880
up.

243
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:03,180
It's like there's a go up and you hear a music version of like frozen music

244
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,480
that that Josh Gad sings and you hear like music versions of that playing as

245
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,180
you're going all the way up the leg of this cow.

246
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,880
And there are vidi screens inside of it playing and replaying movies from the ancient past and beyond.

247
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Josh Gad's movies, his son's movies, and their progeny, so on and so forth.

248
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,880
And then until everyone's attention span was obliterated, it sort of ruined the Gad's movie career.

249
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,880
That's why they moved into computer technologies, computer cells.

250
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Because everyone likes Bites only. Everyone loves Bites instead.

251
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,480
and so you have to have a fun time and flies out of the control terminal

252
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,080
uh... for the elevator

253
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,220
and uh...

254
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:48,960
and uh... the elevator door opens and now it's like this to see this massively

255
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
long haul

256
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,720
uh... with just like a line with computers and automated workers with

257
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,720
the occasional can bone technician ensuring operation continues

258
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,440
beautiful simon says this is where all of the computer technology

259
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,320
that is used by the gads family for gadsville takes place at go

260
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,100
did you hear an echo

261
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,540

529
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,620
Three thrones one for Papa Gads one for mama Gads

530
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:52,700
Then one for baby Gads and you see them all sitting there and you see Papa Gads

531
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,980
is waiting for you all as you slowly walk up and

532
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,120
He says I've been waiting for some time

533
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,100
What who are you three? Who what? What do you want? You?

534
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:12,140
Didn't you ask us to gum? Well, what hold on and then he goes like

535
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,940
claps his hands and one of the one Ken bone attendant like

536
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,940
Waddles over and he takes off his shirt and puts his back facing the gad and the gad is like looking at his back like it's

537
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,220
a list and

538
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,220
finger and turns a page

539
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:32,260
Really see if there's like any pages or anything like that. It's just and he's like, oh, I

"Gads, Gads, you gotta bow! It's the king!"

00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,900
"Konichiwa!"

548

Pennsylvania Jim who thankfully is not a gun city resident.

Yeah he is, no he's my neighbor.

625
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,640
Wait, what did he tell you?

626
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,800
Well he told me that he was from, he was from bullet town.

627
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
He's lying.

628
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Oh man you got duped.

629
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,960
You believed him?

630
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,400
You believed that?

631
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,400
He's not from bullet town?

632
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,400
No.

633
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,920
Are you kidding me?

634
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,080
He's my neighbor, he fucking bangs, he bangs on the walls and stuff.

635
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:28,080
my

636
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,080
With my house. No, it's a whole thing

637
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:48,440
You get confused well, I don't oh I peed my pants this one time because we were waiting for so long and I've been that

638
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,880
I don't know

639
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,080
pants

640
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,680
You know what? I think you three

641
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,440
Give me enough malarkey today

642
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,200
Come back tomorrow. Maybe I'll give you a pass. How about you just how about we just ignore?

643
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,360
Everything we just said get out of my cow kingdom here

644
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,440
I I say okay

645
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,060
We'll wait until tomorrow and then I run around to every clock in the building and I and I fast-forward it

646
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:22,080
Exactly. Don't tell him to stop. Tell him to stop. No, I'm also a clock repairman

647
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,060
Why do we only have analog clocks in here? I need to

648
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:34,460
Because it's a static. No, I know why now but I'm thinking about it and you see how the baby the baby dad

649
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,660
Whisper something to the dad and and the dad the dad said, okay fine

650
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:46,420
Go go my son will escort you out and I see like an example of what the correct pass would look like

651
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:52,420
The baby dad waddles over to you for and

652
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:59,540
Starts walking with you out and he he says that was a pretty good show in there

653
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:03,300
That could have went a lot could have went a lot worse

654
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:08,420
That's a cool voice man. You like the baby from who framed Roger Rabbit. That's a cool last shit, man

655
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,820
Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking

656
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,420
so look if

657
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:21,380
You guys want to get into the land caves I can get my dad to get you in there sooner with no problems

658
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,720
It's a very least I can get that Yoda in there now, but if you want all to get in there I

659
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,640
Got a proposition for you

660
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,860
Whatever it is, I'll do it

661
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:39,880
Marry a baby side of that or you got to break in somehow which could look at that. What's the proposition?

662
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,820
Okay

663
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:45,680
Meet me outside of

664
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:50,720
The toys are us. Oh, that's really easy. Okay, we'll do that. Oh wait

665
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:55,360
This job tell you it's the ideas of you're already at the door. I mean, I'll tell you more there

666
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,560
I'll tell you more there like you're saying no leave

667
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:05,660
Well, thanks, man. I appreciate you making the proposition so easy. Nope. Don't don't take my words. Then twist them around

668
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,260
I'm gonna cry. I'm gonna cry

669
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:12,480
And yeah, you guys leave the the room

670
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,860
So yeah, you guys could break in you could wait till tomorrow

671
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,020
Sounds like you might be able to get the pass

672
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,600
You guys did a pretty good job finessing the king or you can follow

673
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,660
And see what the baby said that you can do. I like this hard-boiled, baby. Oh, yeah

674
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,580
Yeah, he's got like scary Stewie. Mm-hmm. Yeah

675
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,580
Stewie I based him off of

676
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:38,100
Stewie Stewie from family's guy and then I'm the baby from the baby from

677
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,520
Baby's day out a little doing something a little peek behind the curtain for the fans

678
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:50,280
Yeah, well peekaboo behind the curtain if you kind of a baby. Yeah a little baby a little peek behind the carriage

679
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,080
These are a couple of baby references. Yeah

680
00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:02,180
If you are a baby fan, please stop listening to this podcast go to the police

681
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:10,700
Yeah, we're pretty sure you're doing something illegal not sure yet though so yeah you guys

682
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:17,060
Go outside to the Toys R Us with Sullivan the Frog in tow who the whole time is like why don't we just wait till tomorrow

683
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,060
That baby was scary

684
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,860
and

685
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,780
And it's a massive Toys R Us and you see the babies there the baby gads and and he's in disguise

686
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:32,780
he's wearing a little bowler hat and a little over, you know, fucking a

687
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:39,400
Long trench coat and he's like glad you're glad you're wearing that bowler hat now

688
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
now.

689
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,520
Well, I couldn't, I couldn't wear it earlier.

690
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,440
My dad doesn't know about my double life.

691
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,520
Well, you were wearing exactly the same thing earlier.

692
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,080
Now you just have a bowler hat on.

693
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,560
It looks good on you.

694
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,440
I was just trying to say that it looks good.

695
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,080
Oh, well, thank you.

696
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,480
I wasn't, was I wearing the trench coat earlier?

697
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,760
It hides your preceding hairline very well.

698
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,560
I got to remember to change before I go back because if my dad catches me too many times

darker and you start to hear like a crowd almost you should to hear

722
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:53,400
like a bell to hear yelling and you realize that you were brought

723
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,500
to some sort of fighting ring.

724
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Whoa, and and you see the baby gads like

725
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,380
Welcome to the Octagon. I know it only has six sides, okay, but it's called the

726
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,340
Octagon. And yeah, you see this crowd out there is just like fucking cheering like

727
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:22,020
crazy. You see there's a fight going on in the middle of the ring too. The stands are

728
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,700
completely full and he says, you know, in Gadsville we're not allowed to do

729
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,340
anything too unpleasant. Everything's got to be sing-song this, sing-song that. Well

730
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,340
I tell my old man that's why we got the Octagon. He says, what are you talking

We don't got any fighting rings and I show him you all show him. I heard you three are tough

732
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,920

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,900

What's up? What's going on with you? What's going on with the Yoda? Is he afraid of babies?

739
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,100
No! You can't fucking, you can't say that! I don't care, I don't care if you think you

740
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,020
can say that in here. This is an illegal fighting ring.

741
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:41,020
He thinks that you said Dagoba. Yeah, oh I said, oh, oh, okay I'm sorry. Yeah.

742
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,860
Did he not say that? Nope.

743
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:49,140
It's, it's, you know what? A lot of times, baby shit, baby talk just sounds like shit

744
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,660
that George Lucas made up, so I am very sorry about that.

745
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,560
Yeah, all right

746
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,820
I'm sorry for getting to hey, I don't get on your bad side

747
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:05,200
I've heard of stories about you three and they really kill killers of poppy Chuko. Come on. Everybody knows you three. Yeah, man. We're psycho

748
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,820
You're totally psycho you guys with detectives

749
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,760
Say you killed a guy and now you're archaeologists. Nobody can handle you. No, we just go nuts like that

750
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,920
Yeah, it's kind of our swag. I like you three, you know, you're not like the rest of these gads fucking weirdos over here

751
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,100
You're more like all it all the tough guys who live in here. Please stop saying good each one

752
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:36,340
I see in the crowd here. We have to we have two very fat looking zombies

753
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,740
Can we get confirmation that these are the same fat zombies from sawcast about trick? Yeah. Yeah, it's there

754
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,740

00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
children.

756
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,740
They don't know each other.

757
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:52,580
Alright I just want to make sure, I think that's the last same universe thing we needed to tie

758
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,580
together.

759
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,420
I think it's all together now.

760
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
It's finally all together.

761
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,700
If anyone wants to make like a 20 minute fan theory YouTube video essay, you got all the

762
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,700

Also zombies can have kids.

764
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860

765
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,580
Oh, that would be, ooh, zombies can have kids.

766
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,500
speaking as says was some of this crazy bear s fool in the middle

767
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,460

00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,580

769
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,560

You also see in the ring some sort of hooded figure.

And you guys recognize that hooded figure from the auction.

778
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:54,720
The hooded figure who was there and then dashed out right after the ninjas showed up.

779
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,240
And you see the hooded figure and the bear in the ring fighting.

Guess that that drag is your last name the frog. I

867
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,540

Is there a geneticist in here?

1019
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,400
well

1020
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,200
are a nation

1021
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,480
and yet will finish

1022
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,460
uh... solvents initiatives are you been rolled for

1023
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,080
what a great

1024
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,040
five

1025
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,960
it's a five

1026
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,920
and uh... uh... the uh...

1027
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,160
the lizards is

1028
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,920
uh... gonna go second patrick you know

1029
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,920
is

1030
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:57,080
Patrick can I switch with you because I have a special ability if I go before the lizard.

1031
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,080
What's the ability?

1032
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,080
It's assassinate.

1033
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,880
If I attack before the lizard takes a turn it's a guaranteed critical hit.

1034
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,880
Ah ok.

1035
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,640
Then I use my turn to trade my turn to Cameron.

1036
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,800
Can we switch turns?

1037
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,800
Roll a d20.

1038
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,760
If you get above a 10 you can switch turns.

1039
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Ok.

1040
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
18.

1041
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,760
Oh yeah.

1042
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,840
I gotta stop letting shit like this happen.

1043
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:23,840
Oh my god, I can't believe you gave him a 10, dude. That was really the fucking...

1044
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:24,840
I thought it was...

1045
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,840
Yeah, 50 people for the coin!

1046
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,340
Even then, if he gave me anything higher than 10, like if he gave me 15, I still would have won.

1047
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:33,340
Yeah, dude, that's pure power of will right there.

1048
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,340
You're right, that was twag. My bad.

1049
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,340

1050
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:39,340

1056
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:13,180
Mm-hmm. Which is to I guess, it's annoying that I can't measure it and then see. I

1057
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:18,060
think about here. Alright cool, so I move there and then I'm gonna, I'm like 10 feet away from him.

1060
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:31,740
gonna use Super Pipe against him. Yeah. Also you guys, also you guys notice, by the

that's right

1156
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,400

in front of everyone i had to get it done

1168
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,960

1169
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,360
uh... blowtoss

1170
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:15,760

and swings back

1172
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,280
you do have another attack if you want to get their tag or you can move or whatever

1173
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,800

01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,800
Shit, yeah.

1214
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,800
Is that enough?

1215
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,800
No, it's so close.

1216
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:44,800
You just fucking shoot this matrix code out

1217
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,800
and it just enters this lizard's eye

1218
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
and it's like

1219
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,800
trying to, like, it can't understand the code.

1220
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,800
It's eyes are rolling back

1221
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:54,800
in its head as it's being

1222
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,800
overwhelmed by this matrix code.

1223
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:09,800
a

1224
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:15,800
Oh, yeah, sorry shit. Yeah, you're trying to kill me. I know you have a vendetta against me cuz I switch turns

1225
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:22,000
I don't do not don't you don't don't don't you say that I do him now. No, I know

1226
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,680
Did you dude? I never

1227
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,160
By asking if I could do something you let me do it

1228
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:35,240
Cameron constantly outsmarts me. I I have to I'd have to already hate him. You're kidding me. There's no way

1229
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:41,960
I'm gonna take a step closer to the lizard so I can okay close the range and use my dual pipes instead of my super

1230
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,120
Pipe, okay, do it. I'm gonna pie. I'm gonna pipe him. Yeah, I

1231
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:50,480
Mean describe your killing pipe. It's gonna be a lot of damage

1232
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:57,080
Probably eight damage. That's pretty good. Yeah, you got a little roll. But yeah describe your kill. Okay

1233
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,320
so I

1234
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:08,400
Put the pipe over his his slime mold penis like I put it like, you know, I like I put it so it's in the map

1235
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:15,520
and then I just bend the pipe like like I just turn the pipe like and I just snap his little his little right off and

1236
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:21,440
And blood sprays out everywhere tire his entire circulatory system

1237
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,240
Like a

1238
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,480
is getting fire hose of blood his eyes cross

1239
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,280
haha

1240
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,280
goes

1241
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:38,280
oh mommy

1242
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,280
haha

1243
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,280
he just blood just kinda

1244
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,280
and he just deflates

1245
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,280
to this like pile of scaly skin

1246
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,280
and I'm gonna collect that skin and use it to make a jacket later

1247
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,280
yeah you see the announcer like wow holy shit

1248
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,280
that was

1249
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,280
so I did not know that about their anatomy

1250
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
I don't

1251
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:58,280
wow ok

1252
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:00,760
so is there a heart there

1253
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,160
or

1254
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:07,360
like what's going on and i think there is all there and i was a week we wrote a

1255
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,480
paper on this were archaeology is set up

1256
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,840
that's what we're fighting for our geology

1257
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:21,000
graduations to the uh... the winners are the best friends

1258
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,120
and so in the frog

1259
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,540
that he had you all do it for that

1260
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:28,380
is a story of how

1261
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,340
and uh... uh... yeah that was there is no more

1262
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,060
and uh...

1263
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,420
yeah i_c_s_

1267
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:41,880
and that's

1268
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,800
and i don't know that i know that got the lead what the fuck

1269
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:47,760
uh... and uh... so

1270
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:50,840
and uh... yeah as he's saying that

1271
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:57,840
that amazing showing from the best friends but can they keep it going

1272
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,280
now

1273
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,400
if you would you like you'll meet

1274
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,400
does

1275
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,160
in this corner

1276
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:08,140
we see coming out from the underground

1277
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,480
the nasty stinky

1278
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,200
do we do we

1279
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:14,720
purple

1280
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,080
and his giant purple worm first from the ground

1281
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,480
and uh... i thought it off

1282
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,760
Yeah, yeah, it tries to flip you off and it gets sad because it doesn't have hands and gets confused

1283
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:28,400
So does it roll things with disadvantage now?

1284
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,880
Not what happens

1285
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,800
Yeah, it's like a postman. Hey, that's a nice try but ain't gonna happen

1286
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:41,680
And we're gonna keep the uh, same initiative rolls unless you guys want to reroll initiative. No, that's okay

1287
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:47,200
How about this if you want to reroll you can but this is your one reroll

1288
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,520
now i'm not sure

1289
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,160
okay i don't like that

1290
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:52,800
mcconnell and the undead

1291
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,480
right we're rolling for the purple worm

1292
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,920
into the purple worm is going

1293
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:03,520
interesting is a gun first

1294
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,800
blowtoss you are still first

1295
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:07,360
all right uh...

1296
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:12,320
so this purple worm comes out it's looking real nasty and gross and share

1297
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:14,640
i uh...

1298
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,440
I don't think I can go into, I think I need to back off some because I'm low health.

1299
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,520
I'm going to back off a little bit.

1300
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:29,480
I'm going to shoot at it with my Grinch gun with advantage because it hasn't gone yet.

1301
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,680
Okay, go for it.

1302
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,680
Nice, that's a hit.

1303
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,760
Okay, and crit damage is 10.

1304
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,760
Nice.

1305
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:39,880
Yeah, you do 10.

1306
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:44,920
So you just shoot at this worm and the second it pops out, it's like, "Worm!"

1307
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,400
It just takes those Grinch bullets.

1308
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,360
Now, I'm trying to...

1309
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,360
One second.

1310
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,320
I'm trying to look at my Sikkim ability.

1311
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,840
Yeah.

1312
01:10:54,840 --> 01:11:05,280
So, your Sikkim ability should allow you to toss your monkey, and then the monkey can

1313
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,960
just sort of like stay on top of him and continually do damage.

1314
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:15,680
Yeah, and it gives him disadvantage on attacks, which is mostly what I'm interested in. Yeah, so I'm gonna use the second ability. So

1315
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,980
So yeah, you use that and so he has to roll a deck saving throw. So let's see how he does

1316
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:25,660
he does make the save unfortunately for you, so you throw your monkey and

1317
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:28,360
the worm just like

1318
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,240
That's a mother. It's just like knocks the monkey into the wall

1319
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:35,960
And monkey like like scurries back to you running

1320
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,540
But it's you still do

1321
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:44,260
If I'm correct about the second ability, which that to be thinking Luke

1322
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:46,780
oh

1323
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:54,180
Yeah, it's you still do 1d 6 damage because he's monkey like did knock into him. So roll d6 just doesn't stay on all right

1324
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:58,160
Five yeah nice

1325
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:58,420
Yeah

1326
01:11:58,420 --> 01:12:05,380
So the monkey when he hits into the monkey the monkey does like claw at it for a second and he comes back and he's like

1327
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:10,880
Like showing you his hand like like did I do good did I do good? No you suck

1328
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:18,820
Just like crawls inside of your your little vest upset and now it's your turn Patrick Yoda

1329
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,700
I

1330
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,700
Hate this worm so much

1331
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,460
I'm just gonna hover board at it

1332
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:34,140
Nice, dude, that's a hit. Yeah, that's right with six damage

1333
01:12:35,180 --> 01:12:37,180
Yeah

1334
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:39,180
Closer

1335
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:41,180
Mm-hmm go on

1336
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:46,780
No, no, no, no keep going. I was just gonna say. Oh, yeah, the all I was saying was I'm moving closer

1337
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,480
Okay

1338
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:47,620
Yeah

1339
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:51,280
You sling the hoverboard at him and you hear the announcer goes and there goes

1340
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,380
Patrick Yoda's hoverboard once again

1341
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:58,160
And it flies in the air and like you like just like sort of like slinging at it like a straight shot

1342
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,460
It just like gets the worm in the head and it's like

1343
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,340
Like kind of like seeing stars a little bit

1344
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:08,780
uh... it's it's dead now

1345
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:09,660
it's not that

1346
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,020
worth a shot

1347
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,140
uh...

1348
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,500
the as a good try

1349
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:15,980
the confused him

1350
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,340
the a_t_f_ use me for a second there was a good said yes it would have had to

1351
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:20,020
count

1352
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,900
yet but i think i can't use it is that yes really fast so you can't just try to

1353
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:26,340
keep tricking me that were says what

1354
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,540

1363
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,140

1382
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:29,500
i don't really know what this friendly shit is so i'm gonna try and draw as much

1383
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:33,500
stuff on the map to obscure everything as possible.

1499
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:27,920
He's gonna roll a...

1500
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,000
Or a fuck, or whatever the worm does to him.

1501
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I don't care.

1502
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:37,720
The worm's gonna have to roll a wisdom saving throw to resist...

1503
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:40,720
I worm or he's worm?

1504
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:42,760
He's worm.

1505
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,760
This worm, the purple worm, has to resist the charms.

1506
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,960
What color's my worm?

1507
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:50,480
Okay.

1508
01:19:50,480 --> 01:20:03,540
So this worm, who should know better, instead, pops out of the ground, and Sid goes "OOOH

1509
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:09,100
LA LA!"

1510
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:12,420
And Patrick Yoda also is popped out of the ground.

1511
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:13,420
"BLEEEEGH!

1512
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,060
THERE'S A MUDDER IN MY MOUTH RIGHT NOW!

1513
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,060
THERE'S A MUDDER!"

1514
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,660
I say, "You can look, but you can't touch the merchandise, kid. Not till you pay up.

1515
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:35,300
Give me that Yoda." And you see the worm go, "Oh, come on! Come on!" No, no, no. Okay, sorry to add

1516
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:42,380
Patrick Yoda's character back in unexpectedly for me. Goddamn. And yeah,

1517
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:51,420
And so the worm is like and just releases Patrick Yoda and just like is making

1518
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:56,220
like heart eyes at the big worm and the big worm it's just like making it's like

1519
01:20:56,220 --> 01:21:04,580

1520
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:05,680
facial features.

01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:12,380
It might as well be like it's like it's like Lady and the

1526
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:30,680

the

1824
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:36,520
the

1825
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:42,800
That you didn't know were there and it's just like a really giant creepy zombie hand

1826
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:50,580
That is just like master handing over you all like just doing its little like fucking floating master hand kind of shit

1827
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,560
But it's like decay

1828
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:54,320
You weird

Yeah, very weird. Yeah, very weird gives you a shocker brah at that

1830
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,680
Okay, you cool

1831
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:08,820
And yeah, it rolled and it's gonna go first so you're all now trapped in this foreskin by the way, uh

1832
01:36:08,820 --> 01:36:14,820
And you have to make a strength saving throw on your turn, but for now

1833
01:36:14,820 --> 01:36:17,800
It's the creepy hands turn

1834
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:25,920
So, let's get this going hold on a second we get the creepy hands shit in order

1835
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,480
Okay

1836
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,480
It is going to

1837
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:36,300
It basically sees all of you and it its hand like

1838
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:39,400
Wait, it has a hand -

1839
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:43,980
Has a hand its whole body

1840
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,800
rather

1841
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:53,840
wretches upwards and you see in the middle of the palm a like butthole and you see the butthole just

1842
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,400
like open up and then you just see us you hear

1843
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:01,040
And a swarm of locusts come outside

1844
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:08,040
of its hand. And I need all of you to roll a wisdom saving throw.

1845
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,040
Crit 20. 9. No, it's a crit 1.

1846
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,040
Let's see how Sullivan does.

1847
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:25,040
Okay. Okay. So, the people who saved, you know, who got, so are Cameron,

1848
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:37,040
And both of you are going to take half damage and you will not be frightened by the bugs.

1849
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,040
Half of our HP?

1850
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,040
No, half total damage from the attack.

1851
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:44,040
No, don't worry, not half your HP.

1852
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:45,040
Not yet.

1853
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:47,040
That was a close one.

1854
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:50,040
So you're both going to take four.

1855
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:58,040
Patrick Yoda and Ray William Johnson, you take nine points of damage.

1856
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:03,040
And you're also frightened of the bugs.

1857
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:11,040
So now these locusts that are around you, they're just like, you have to be at least like 30 feet away from them.

1858
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:13,040
Like you have to move away from them.

1859
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:16,440
and you're having trouble moving from them because, you know,

1860
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:21,940
you're trapped in foreskin, and so these bugs are hovering around you in the foreskin,

1861
01:38:21,940 --> 01:38:27,240
and then also you have disadvantage on any attacks while these bugs are in your line of sight.

1862
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:32,740
But you can make a wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn also to try to shake off that fear.

1863
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:36,640
But that's what the hand does, and then the hand does one other thing,

1864
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:39,580
which is that it

1865
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,340
uh... it

1866
01:38:42,340 --> 01:38:44,800
it uh... does the thing

1867
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,420
where you guys ever see somebody like move their knuckle

1868
01:38:48,420 --> 01:38:49,660
around

1869
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:55,300
it starts moving its knuckle around and you have to roll another wisdom saving throw

1870
01:38:55,300 --> 01:38:59,100
it was too creepy thirteen yeah it's doing the weird thing where it moves the knuckle around

1871
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,700
oh wait that's not a saving throw i'll have to add

1872
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:05,900
oh that's the same that's the same modifier as a saving throw okay eleven

1873
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:06,780
yeah

1874
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:09,020
uh... blowtoss piss

1875
01:39:09,020 --> 01:39:12,360
you are stunned

1876
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,020
you see this creepy got hand moving its knuckle around

1877
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:20,220
and it's freaking you the fuck out you hate when people do that

1878
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,060
uh...

1879
01:39:21,060 --> 01:39:25,700
and you are stunned which basically means you can't move

1880
01:39:25,700 --> 01:39:28,320
you can only speak falteringly

1881
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:32,180
attack rolls against you have advantage and you automatically fail any strength

1882
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:35,900
dexterity saving throws so you can't even get out of the foreskin now

1883
01:39:35,900 --> 01:39:37,880
until you're able to do it

1884
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,480
they were gonna die

1885
01:39:39,480 --> 01:39:41,180
senior stunned for

1886
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:42,520
uh... one around

1887
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:45,040
okay so

1888
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:46,680
uh... now

1889
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,180
at the hand did its thing

1890
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:51,520
now it is your turn blowtoss

1891
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,280
you can't do anything you're just trapped in this for skin stunned by the

1892
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,440
way i can speak falteringly

1893
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,280
i think we do

1894
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:02,060

1895
01:40:02,060 --> 01:40:04,200

you're not a lot of force can i should say

1897
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,580
patrick you know that because you know any who put it around your friends

1898
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:12,520
so you can move around you just have to get away from the bugs that are like in

1899
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:14,360
this area

1900
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:16,960

01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,180
set carry all them with me

1902
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:21,500

1921
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:20,560
is

1922
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:21,880
we get to the next

1923
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:24,160
okay next time

1924
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:24,920
yeah i mean

1925
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,160
but i mean you can i can i

1926
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:31,540
uh... right so what should i do should i get a with uh... the hoverboard

1929
01:41:38,420 --> 01:41:39,580
seventeen

1930
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:43,660
that's good that hits you have used a force which is very good

1931
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:46,020
uh... it basically just powers you up

1932
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,140
uh...

1933
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:50,440
uh... should have done that before you hit yet should

1934
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,820
but your business

1935
01:41:51,820 --> 01:41:54,140
so this is not a report every time

1936
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,620
yeah

1937
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:57,740
well

1938
01:41:57,740 --> 01:42:00,820
yeah i mean you sling a number of or did not have any and

1939
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:03,620
uh... not seem chips and they always like

1940
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:05,620
and makes a noise similar to the word

1941
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,820
packets of the inmates mail

1942
01:42:07,820 --> 01:42:10,620
uh... you see it like doing like the you know

1943
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:13,460
uh... front way the back way it's against nails

1944
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:14,980
uh...

1945
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:18,900
and uh... yeah i mean you have another attack to if you want to

1946
01:42:18,900 --> 01:42:20,860
i should say shit fuck israelis

1947
01:42:20,860 --> 01:42:23,360
is your freedom bugs near your line of sight

1948
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:29,520
do disadvantage in these tax uh... so do i re-roll that yet yet strong and

1949
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,920
maybe you'll be okay

1950
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,560
and maybe

1951
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:34,940
call

1952
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:39,400
it's too bad twenty four was a correct but you get to get the lower one

1953
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,480
c still do damage at least

1954
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:42,360
okay uh...

1955
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:44,740
but you can roll you could do another attack

1956
01:42:44,740 --> 01:42:48,600
with disadvantage and you can roll the c_d_ no longer be afraid of the bugs

1957
01:42:48,600 --> 01:43:08,160
a

1958
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:22,040
the

1959
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:24,180
uh... now this is like your one

1960
01:43:24,180 --> 01:43:27,820
your superset your one super saiyan transformation you have okay

1961
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:32,180
but it's pretty good so patrick is the forpia uses the force uses the force for

1962
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:33,600
thirty seconds

1963
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,080
uh... which basically is five turns in d_n_d_

1964
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:41,300
self uh... is a_c_ increases by two

1965
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:43,040
your movement speed is doubled

1966
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:46,360
and you can fly up to sixty feet vertically

1967
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,500
your physical tax all due plus two additional damage

1968
01:43:49,500 --> 01:43:54,100
uh... based on a wisdom d_c_ check and then based on the size of the object

1969
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:56,960
patrick you're taking also move things around

1970
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,940
uh... and as a passive ability

1971
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:04,120
uh... also patrick it gets advantage on all saving throws this is why this is

1972
01:44:04,120 --> 01:44:05,420
also a good move

1973
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:07,620
because they're gonna have an advantage on this was the same thing you're about

1974
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:08,540
to do

1975
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:09,460
and

1976
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:10,560
finally

1977
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:11,740
patrick gata

1978
01:44:11,740 --> 01:44:14,460
can do it at new attack

1979
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:15,780
uh... force lightning

1980
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:18,580
this is forty eight lightning damage

1981
01:44:18,580 --> 01:44:22,980
and also you can do like another move do a bunch of shit and then as a bonus

1982
01:44:22,980 --> 01:44:25,560
action just do the lightning instead for two d six

1983
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,840
so when you when you

1984
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:29,660
when you tap into the force what happens you betcha

1985
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,500
i can't just sit there like

1986
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:36,040
you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know you know

1987
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:37,340
yet you hear the anthro

1988
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:42,420
i can't tell if this is racist or not but it's getting crazy and yes i would

1989
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:45,540
grow with some saving throw with advantage now to be no longer afraid of

1990
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:46,580
the bugs

1991
01:44:46,580 --> 01:44:51,660
okay with some through with the community

1992
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:54,560
to a very high with twenty seven

1993
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:57,100
you dislike stare at those bugs and you're like

1994
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:59,260
you can't scare me

1995
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:01,660
and that's right you tell those books

1996
01:45:01,660 --> 01:45:03,900
yeah like no thanks and now

1997
01:45:03,900 --> 01:45:08,500
by the way as a bonus action you can shoot lightning now to

1998
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:11,580
let's go

1999
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,540
so you can't you know i guess you lightning

2000
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:14,540
the roll.

2001
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:21,660
That was real time how long it took that sentence to get into Patrick's brain.

2002
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:24,660
I thought you were talking to camera.

2003
01:45:24,660 --> 01:45:26,460
I'm sorry.

2004
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:30,820
So where do I, what do I click to roll the lightning?

2005
01:45:30,820 --> 01:45:36,540
So it's not in here so what you just do is just do hokey surprise, that's the same attack

2006
01:45:36,540 --> 01:45:37,540
bonus.

2007
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,540
Okay.

2008
01:45:38,540 --> 01:45:39,540

Um, yeah, you can't get out of it.

01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:45,280
You're stuck in that force game.

01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,240
Oh fuck, everyone's gonna die.

01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:41,680
Yeah, that was a clutch move to use tough force. It is now Sullivan's turn. He has to roll a death saving throw. Oh

2145
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,860
Okay

2146
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:47,980
All right success, so he's doing okay

2147
01:52:47,980 --> 01:52:55,480
He has he has to either succeed three times to stabilize or fail three times to die. So he's doing okay right now

2148
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:58,540
But now it's your turn Ray William Johnson

2149
01:52:58,540 --> 01:53:01,020

Alright, well, I'm not even gonna roll a second one.

2157
01:53:29,180 --> 01:53:34,180
You said, "Offering your hand to this hand is a slur in its culture."

2158
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:37,180
- It is just so-- - Down low?

2159
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,180

2160
01:53:39,180 --> 01:53:43,180
Okay. I'll let you try to attack it still, just 'cause that was funny.

2161
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:45,180
- That made me laugh. - Okay.

2162
01:53:45,180 --> 01:53:48,180

2163
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,180

2164
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:53,180
Yeah, you just, like, insult it and then just whiff with the slur.

2166
01:53:56,820 --> 01:53:58,320
uh...

2167
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,420

2168
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:01,660
but kill me soon so uh...

2169
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:03,180
see you next time buddy

2170
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:06,300

01:54:06,300 --> 01:54:08,260
it is the hands turn again

2172
01:54:08,260 --> 01:54:12,020
and it is going to try to fuckin stop you

2173
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:13,720
it turns to a fist

2174
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:15,440
to like fuckin bop you

2175
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,400
uh... so here goes

2176
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:18,620
it does hit you

2177
01:54:18,620 --> 01:54:20,180
does uh...

2178
01:54:20,180 --> 01:54:22,340
does thirteen damage

2179
01:54:22,340 --> 01:54:28,440
And you are now in the ground like half your body like a bomb like a cordiand down. Yeah

2180
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:30,440
I'm yeah, okay, and

2181
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:34,340
Yeah, and so you're not gonna be able to move

2182
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:41,420
Until you roll a strength saving the best of this game and oh good. Yeah, and

2183
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:47,000
You also might have to deal with some mealworms as well. Uh and now

2184
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:53,680
It is going to fly over to you Patrick Yoda because you've been doing a lot of damage to it. Oh, well

2185
01:54:53,680 --> 01:55:01,880
It's gonna walk on its fingers. It doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity from Caleb. Oh, you know what? Thank you

2186
01:55:01,880 --> 01:55:04,520
Feel like a bad DM it does

2187
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:12,080
So when a creature moves out of your range and you have a reaction you can use it provokes an attack of opportunity

2188
01:55:12,080 --> 01:55:14,240
You can use an attack on it

2189
01:55:14,640 --> 01:55:20,420
So for you that means you can use dong blade on it as it's moving on a wrench. Thank you Cameron for keeping me honest

2190
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:23,240
But I'm in the ground

2191
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:26,020
Yeah, but like you got it Caleb. Just do it

2192
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:29,840
Stuck in the ground

2193
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:36,240
No, it's your your your legs you can't move but your arms are totally fucking available brother

2194
01:55:36,240 --> 01:55:38,920
All right. It doesn't feel good, but I will do it. I

Okay, you whiff you're just like

01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:46,840
Swinging it around it like as it's like going by you

2198
01:55:46,840 --> 01:55:50,660
But still not bad, but Patrick Yoda not bad

2199
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:57,080
You know not bad for missing I guess and Patrick Yoda. It's now it's now coming after you and

2200
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:03,680
You see that it's going to try to flick you the way it did solve in the frog

2201
01:56:03,680 --> 01:56:10,240
And it misses it just like flicks against the wall of the arena because you're up against the wall and it's like going like this

2202
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:32,520
like

2203
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:38,960

2204
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:44,120
run over and try to stabilize Sullivan. Okay. That line represents that I moved

2205
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:52,920
over there. Okay I'll move you over. So roll a medicine check. Okay. 19. Okay 19 you

2206
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:58,520

2207
01:56:58,520 --> 01:57:05,520
though. But he's not gonna keep dying now. Yeah. And now it is your turn Patrick Yoda.

2208

01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,500
and uh...

2251
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:11,480
he says uh...

2252
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:13,060
just meet just come back

2253
01:59:13,060 --> 01:59:14,680
to the gateway cow tomorrow

2254
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,980
you have my word

2255
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:17,040
okay i'll go

2256
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,300
and i'll get you those passes

2257
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,920
and uh... uh...

2258
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:24,760
yeah he says that to you guys

2259
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:25,980
yeah you guys uh...

2260
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:30,140
walk out of the camera you still going to take a picture of him

2261
01:59:30,140 --> 01:59:37,140
the

2262
01:59:37,140 --> 01:59:41,680
You know how hmm so your back his back is turned right as

2263
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:48,740
He's walking away. You can do that. But then obviously the disadvantage there is that then so what is it?

2264
01:59:48,740 --> 01:59:50,740
Just a little man in a coat

2265
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:52,820
but

2266
01:59:52,820 --> 01:59:56,860
You could do it from the front I will here's what I'll say it's it's an arena

2267
01:59:56,860 --> 02:00:01,460
There's a lot of commotion like it's it's doable

2268
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:05,900
And I and if you fuck it up, you just have to play it off. You see what I'm saying?

2269
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:11,640
Yeah, okay, but it's up to you cuz yeah you could do should I should I do it and then try to play it off like

2270
02:00:11,640 --> 02:00:13,800
I'm retreat taking a victory. Okay, wait, we're gonna

2271
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:19,120
We'll huddle up shit. We're gonna huddle up like we're gonna be taking a victory selfie

2272
02:00:19,120 --> 02:00:23,120
Okay, but the camera is facing the other way

2273
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:26,700
Okay, so roll

2274
02:00:26,700 --> 02:00:31,920
Okay, I'm trying to think of what to roll here and roll performance check

2275
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:37,780
Do it dude, okay, I got a 45

2276
02:00:37,780 --> 02:00:47,060
I've a really I have a bad performance score though. We got this. It's easy if all of us roll. There's no way we lose

2277
02:00:47,060 --> 02:01:00,100
Yeah, it looks pretty obviously like you're trying to include him in the frame and he's like no no no no

2278
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:04,060
You can't you can't have me in the frame. Okay, I can't have my dad seen. Come on you. Oh, sorry

2279
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:09,060
You're like our coach for this win. I pour a Gatorade bottle on him.

2280
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:16,060
Oh my god, I'm all sticky and like he's like crying a little bit like a baby.

2281
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:20,060
Just come back to the cow, we can deal with this then, alright?

2282
02:01:20,060 --> 02:01:22,060
Alright, I just can't be seen anywhere, okay?

2283
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:25,060
Okay, okay, we'll get you the passes though, okay?

2284
02:01:25,060 --> 02:01:29,060
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go. I'm all fucking sticky now, it's disgusting.

2285
02:01:29,060 --> 02:01:32,060
He's just, starts to walk out of there.

2286
02:01:32,060 --> 02:01:33,140
Okay

2287
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:34,260
Yeah

2288
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:39,660
So it's a nice try but like I think the method in which you did it is enough that like he's not suspicious

2289
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:45,900
Like if you did it just like trying to sneak a pic. I think that would have been a little bit more obvious

2290
02:01:45,900 --> 02:01:48,420
yeah, you see Marie and Rex and

2291
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:52,060
Rex is like boys. That was a hell of a show

2292
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:56,380
Look look Marie and I were gonna get drinks. We meant it will get you guys drinks

2293
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:59,180
You fucking killed it in there the way you took out that hand

2294
02:01:59,700 --> 02:02:03,940
They banned me from this because I I tried to play jump rope with one of their spines

2295
02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:10,500
but you guys uh, you guys have fucking avenged that for sure you guys are incredible incredible fighters and

2296
02:02:10,500 --> 02:02:17,140
Marine says those are my two lovers and their friend and their frog. That's what they're like

2297
02:02:17,140 --> 02:02:21,740
Can you guys order me a drink that gets me out of the ground

2298
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:27,820
Everyone laughs

2299
02:02:27,820 --> 02:02:29,820
It's the end of a thing.

2300
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:31,820
It's the end of an episode.

2301
02:02:31,820 --> 02:02:51,820
