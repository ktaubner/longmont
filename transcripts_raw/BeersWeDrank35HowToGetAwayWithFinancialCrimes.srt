1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
and there we go

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,320
[sips]

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
[burps]

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,320
You're listening to Beers We Drank, America's #1 beer podcast.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,320
America's #1 beer podcast.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
[record scratch]

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,320
[music]

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
What's up, all my chuggers?

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,320
I'm trying to get that burp out.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,320
[burps]

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
This is a journey into...

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
Into into...

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
Plain and simple.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Bud Light.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Half-Fu Ribbon.

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,840
Here's we drank motherfucker with Juvio Caleb and Rex

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:45,880
That was a completely hurt nothing beers we drank

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:55,520
We are we are back do we take a break? No, we didn't

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,400
We are back after a one-week hiatus where we took six days off between recording guys

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:10,400
This what I have today is for my sober gophers guys. It's so it's over November

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,400
Until Thanksgiving guys, that's what we're doing this month until Thanksgiving and my wife's birthday

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:22,020
We're having no drinks at all except maybe next week. I'll have a beer but just because

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,080
Listen, I'm taking some time off of drinking because my stomach is hurting, guys.

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,400
I have some kind of stomach disease, I think, or maybe some autoimmune disorder.

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,920
It could be Hashimoto's disease, and it could have been why I lost my hair.

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,080
I'm looking into the matter.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:45,320
But for now, I'm here to enjoy a Lagunitas Hoppy Refresher Sparkling Hop Water.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,720
Guys, gophers, this is zero calories.

29
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,280
This is zero carbs.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,040
This has a blue dog that can swim right on the front of the can.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,240
Let's take ourselves a sip and give a review.

32
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,200
Guys, that tastes like Sprite.

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
And I like Sprite.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,760
This is, on the gopher scale, this is what a gopher is like.

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,920
This is 8 burrowing holes out of 10 burrowed holes.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,920
the

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:36,400
are

38
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't like not drinking. I'm looking backwards to this to drink this.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,400
But then when I take a sip it actually tastes like soda.

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll go with my beer next. Yes, go ahead.

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
I have a Diaco. I'm just kidding. I have a

42
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
neon bear hug. Whoa!

43
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
We're kind of twinning with mascots here. Yeah. I have a bear and

44
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
sunglasses. And this says it has

45
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,880
Can you can is this readable there it is maybe like 10 000 volts of flavor 10 000 volts

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:19,040
man it's gonna shock you and kill you that shit man wait is it false no maybe it's the one that

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
doesn't kill you maybe it's amps no maybe it's the other way around power is cyclical

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,120
okay nerd did you die now i wish you died when you drank that you look like john lennon

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
We've been over this man. We've been over this shit.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
You look like if Adolf Hitler had AIDS.

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,440
What the hell is that? That was weak.

52
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,320
That was weak dude. I meant to say the target. AIDS and Hitler.

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,640
Come on man. What is it? 2010?

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,080
Well, okay. You think AIDS and being

55
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,400
actively disabled in this game? Yeah, go ahead.

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Keep saying, keep saying stuff.

57
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
watched all of Family Guy in a row now.

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,840
Yes.

59
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Okay.

60
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,000
And now I have to go back and watch episodes that I fell asleep during.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,320
And it used to be okay to say stuff like that.

63
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,760
And I sometimes forget that it's not.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,760
You also don't have to do that, by the way.

65
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,680
Well what would I do?

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,680
Something else.

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,000
You could watch a better television show.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Like what?

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Name a better television show.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The news.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Than Family Guy?

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yeah, than Family Guy.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Dude, the office.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,400
The office, the news, the weather.

75
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,600
The office also used to be kind of crazy, man.

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,120
Today, I went over to Pat's house and me, him, and Cam, and Alex watched Family Guy,

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,080
Most Racist Moments, and The Office, Most Racist Moments.

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Which one was more racist?

79
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,080
The Family Guy.

80
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Definitely Family Guy.

81
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Definitely Family Guy.

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
The Office had some stuff.

83
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,240
It did have one thing that was really funny where Michael dressed up as Daryl for Halloween,

84
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,260
Obviously didn't do blackface, but he did have one smudge on the side of his neck like he started doing it

85
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,260
I

86
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,960
Had never noticed that before but it was really making me laugh

87
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,220
I don't find the office very funny, but I do find family guy. He dresses up like McGruber

88
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,500
I mean, I only what we okay. We watch the most racist and the hallow all the Halloween moments

89
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,940
All right. I'm gonna I'm gonna come here and cut straight to the cheese. I have never watched either

90
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,060
there you never seen the office man or family guy now you never seen family guy

91
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:40,100
I've maybe watched an episode or two but like on in a hotel I thought somebody

92
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
He does bring up a good point, he said you're gonna cut the cheese.

93
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
That means farting!

94
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:49,100
My beard today is a local beard.

95
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
You're gonna cut the cheese?

96
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,100
And I'm talking, I'm gonna get the cheese?

97
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I'm cutting right through the cheese, I'm farting.

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:02,100
You are talking like Peter.

99
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
I've never seen that before.

100
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,100
This is a local beard.

101
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
This is the beard, they made this at my house, basically.

102
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,500
- Cartablanca?

103
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,220
- Yeah, of course I made it at your house

104
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,340
because it's the Blanca house.

105
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,180
- Damn.

106
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,020
- It is now the most sought out--

107
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,220
- To be a Blanca.

108
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,420
- It is the most sought out after beer in Mexico City,

109
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,300
I've been told by my sources.

110
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,340
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,740
- And-- - Sought out in what way?

112
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,060
- Bought, that's what sought out means.

113
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,780
- They love it and they look at it for it

114
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,740
and they buy it and they drink it most times.

115
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,420
- Well, is it rare to find?

116
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,500
- It's good.

117
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,460
Apparently all the whiteys that moved to Mexico City over COVID, they really like it.

118
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,340
So this is like their drink of choice.

119
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
It's the Blanca beer.

120
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,340
It's light.

121
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Give me some notes.

122
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,300
What are you tasting?

123
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,300
It's a really light beer.

124
00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:00,780
It might be even lighter than the White Tecate.

125
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,300
It's really light and it doesn't taste horrible so I give it a 1 million.

126
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,660
- You can't make a fucking--

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,380
- I give it a one million.

128
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,220
- Can't make a joke of the rating.

129
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,980
- I've given it a one million.

130
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,580
- Would you, you know what we need guys?

131
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,060
I just realized this.

132
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,900
- Yeah.

133
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,180
- We have never, we always try to describe

134
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,980
what these beers are like and we never make any sense

135
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,180
and we always make a fool of ourselves.

136
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:33,840
We need a little bit of a lesson.

137
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,840
And so I'm on glacier-design.com/beertasting101.

138
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,160
And so let me, now that I've read this entire thing

139
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,760
very easily in one single look,

140
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,920
now I'm going to taste this again and give it the notes.

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,760
- Beertasting, adjusting your beer goggles.

142
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,400
There's goggles?

143
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,240
- Okay guys, this is spring-like, spruce-like,

144
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,720
elegant, grassy,

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,880
piney, citrusy,

146
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,340
and zippy.

147
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
How to speak to beer.

148
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,120
This article is crazy.

149
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,640
Oh, wait.

150
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:08,840
Yeah.

151
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,760
This is a soft white beer.

152
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,280
And it's light and it's delicious.

153
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,760
Okay.

154
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,280
I would give it a million out of 10.

155
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,360
You can't, you, you, you realize how that skews every other rating we've ever done

156
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,240
where now this is no, cause me and me and Rex are never, ever going to rate anything

157
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
over a 10. Or even a 10. A 10 is crazy.

158
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,440
That's what I'm saying. I'm saying it's outstanding.

159
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,400
So do they give it a... let me rate the beer for you.

160
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,840
8.9. You can't give it a million.

161
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Whoever is keeping track of these on some kind of psychotic

162
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,280
spreadsheet, strike a million from the record.

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,360
Strike one million from the record. This is an 8.9.

164
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,000
Two million. You haven't even tasted it. You can't get this in New York City.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,880
No beer is a 10 even.

166
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
No beer is a million.

167
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
That breaks the scale, man.

168
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Say it right now.

169
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,920
You're right.

170
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
I could get that in New York City.

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
That's not true.

172
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
Probably.

173
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
You can get anything in this beautiful city where many cultures walk into each other.

174
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Yes, I could do it.

175
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,600
Get a rent under $5,000.

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,280
My rent's under $5,000?

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,920
Well under.

178
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Well under half, man.

179
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,960
All right, I'm going to fill out my beer evaluation sheet.

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
So the color-

181
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Okay.

182
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:42,360
The color is gold, the clarity is dull, it has a good head, it has a middle to faint

183
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,320
aroma with a slightly sweet balance.

184
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,120
The malt, I'm getting a very sweet grain and maybe a nutty aroma.

185
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,920
The hops are very resiny and floral.

186
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,200
It's a neutral impression.

187
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,920
I'm getting a medium intensity flavor.

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:13,720
Slightly sweet, slightly bitter with a bread and nut.

189
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh.

190
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
Yeah.

191
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,120
Oh my.

192
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
And so now, what is your rating out of 10?

193
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,880
Did you already say?

194
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,480
You might want to re-evaluate after you've said all these things.

195
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Let's take this shit seriously for fucking once, man.

196
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
I would give this like a 7.2.

197
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,280
And that's how you know I'm taking it seriously, is because I'm really just...

198
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,880
It's not even a good score, but it's above average.

199
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Yeah, that's a good score.

200
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,880
That's a decent score.

201
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
You, shut up, bitch!

202
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
You just gave that beer 2 million.

203
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Yeah.

204
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,880
Fuck you!

205
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,440
Hey, this can, I really do not like the design of this can.

206
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,240
It might be affecting your, it might have affected your initial impression for sure.

207
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Yeah.

208
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,120
It's, it's surprisingly not flavorful despite describing itself as 10,000 volts of flavor.

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,960
Mmm, yes.

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Well volts are not flavorful.

211
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,960
It's like hops.

212
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,840
Yeah, yeah, I don't think volts would taste like all that much.

213
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,360
You don't get shocked and you go like, "That was really good."

214
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
You have to have been shocked.

215
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,000
I got another one of those. I almost got shocked last night.

216
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,280
Two nights ago actually.

217
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,640
You ever get shocked and you can't move at all?

218
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,440
That almost happened to me, yeah.

219
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,320
That happened to me one time.

220
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,600
Cause my dad didn't put the...

221
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
When I was like maybe 13,

222
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,040
I had no idea how electric outlets worked.

223
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,960
And my dad never put a faceplate on one of the electric outlets

224
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,320
and it just hung out of the wall.

225
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,360
And I grabbed the back of it to plug in my computer.

226
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:43,960
And I just went...

227
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,720
I just sat there for like five seconds.

228
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
and I kinda liked it.

229
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,080
It kinda felt a little bit good.

230
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,920
- So it was flavorful then?

231
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,840
- Yeah, no, wait, it was, yeah, yeah, no,

232
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,440
the tongue feel was definitely interesting.

233
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,280
- Okay.

234
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,920
- Oh yeah, I didn't talk about its full body mouth feel

235
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,240
with a lively carbonation

236
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,880
and a slick and astringent mouth coating

237
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,320
while being slightly prickly

238
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,800
with a long finish and a short intensity

239
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,000
and a bitter balance.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,840
- Yum.

241
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,080
- And excellent craftsmanship.

242
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
- Okay, I'm starting to see why we don't do this every week.

243
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,720
- Yeah, it's horrible.

244
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,400
- This is really light and it's really so delicious to drink.

245
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,040
- Sam Hagenfried has been found, say it.

246
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,080
- Guilty on all seven counts.

247
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,920
- Is that true?

248
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,960
I actually didn't know.

249
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
- Okay, let's get into this.

250
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,480
Number one.

251
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,000
- You were innocent?

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,160
- Yeah, dude, why is it?

253
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
I don't give a fuck about financial crime.

254
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,440
Nobody should go to prison for stealing money.

255
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,280
- Thank you, thank you.

256
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,040
- The only thing that should get you in prison

257
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,680
is bodily harm.

258
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,080
- Yes.

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,540
Financial crimes are awesome.

260
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,380
- Yes.

261
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,320
I mean, if you get away with them,

262
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,780
even from the beginning, if you get away with them,

263
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,160
you should be just, you should have to stop doing it,

264
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,120
I think, but you shouldn't go to jail.

265
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
That's absurd.

266
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,280
- I have never read, 'cause here's the thing.

267
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,480
New York is the court of law for financial crimes.

268
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,200
They give out the statements every time.

269
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,980
And they're always like, they stole $200 million, they bought a McLaren, they bought a mansion,

270
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,120
they took a bunch of flights on private jets, and I'm like, these guys are awesome.

271
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,080
This is what everyone should do.

272
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,040
Have they never seen the movie, have they never seen Blank Check?

273
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
You remember this movie?

274
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,800
They think that kid should be on Rikers Island, reading the Quran in an orange jumpsuit?

275
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,000
That's what they think should happen to that child.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,580
just because he had the guts to steal millions of dollars from a man.

277
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,440
Yeah. Wait, did he even do any, any of that? Like cool shit.

278
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,360
I thought it was just like,

279
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,620
it would just like lock himself up in like in his apartment and just played league

280
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,920
SPF. That's cool.

281
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,940
He literally bought like a skyscraper in the Bahamas and had orgies in it and

282
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,660
took amphetamine,

283
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:11,440
like experimental uppers that cost $2,000 a patch.

284
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,420
I didn't know he was doing patches.

285
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:14,900
Yeah.

286
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,420
He had some experimental drug that he took as a patch and it costs like $2,000.

287
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,340
No, he.

288
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,820
No, he was fucked up.

289
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,280
Um, all the time.

290
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,620
That's why, and he was awful at league, which is why he was cringe.

291
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,980
Did you see the picture of him from the court?

292
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,220
Like the drawing where he literally looks like the most handsome man on earth.

293
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:36,460
Yeah.

294
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,740
They drew him to be like the chat meme basically.

295
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,460
Yeah.

296
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,580
He straight up looks and there's like another one from that day where he literally looks like a rat

297
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm more inclined to believe the handsome one. Yes

298
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,500
There's like there's a because the thing is anytime someone gets a piece of financial crime, they're just like

299
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,100
the coolest guy of all

300
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,820
It looks sick

301
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:29,500
He literally looks like Brad Pitt from Fight Club, it looks amazing he looks

302
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,020
gorgeous

303
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,900
It shouldn't be allowed to look that you there's they're saying this guy needs to go to prison

304
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
and look at how good looking he is, well dressed.

305
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,620
Look at all these schlubs in the back who are all wearing the same clothes and have no face.

306
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,620
These people should be in jail.

307
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:49,620
Look at these, see this is actually amazing, this is an amazing, amazing photo, and this

308
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,020
is a photo by the way, because here it is, Sam Bankman Freed, this is exactly what his

309
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
life is.

310
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,060
He's the main character, he looks amazing, he has amazing sex with the most beautiful

311
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
women you've ever seen.

312
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,060
In the back, all NPCs.

313
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:06,400
NPCs that just need to be robbed, I mean, they need to be robbed like in Skyrim when

314
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,160
and you take gold off of the counter,

315
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,200
and they say, "Ah, what are you doing, man?"

316
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,120
That's what he was doing.

317
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,480
There's nothing wrong with anything he did.

318
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,520
- Why are we still doing the little drawings at this point?

319
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,360
- Just take photos, I don't understand.

320
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,200
- Yeah, I don't understand.

321
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,280
- What's the archaic rule?

322
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,320
- Who's like, it's big drawings being like,

323
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,680
we need to lobby that we should still be doing drawings

324
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,520
instead of taking pictures.

325
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,240
- It is, it's these fucking artists.

326
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,640
- Someone has to say it.

327
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,080
- We should give that to an AI.

328
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,600
Artists run the government and the banks.

329
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,440
- That is true.

330
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,920
I hate those damn artists.

331
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,840
- That's real shit.

332
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,040
Okay, so Rex, what do you think would have been,

333
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,280
because you're tapped into this whole thing.

334
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,840
What would you think would have been an appropriate,

335
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,640
fair, long arm of the law style justice

336
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,280
against Mr. Sam Bankman-Freed

337
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,920
for the crimes that he's committed?

338
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:10,320
I think he should be in solitary confinement, but like Norwegian style.

339
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,320
Okay.

340
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,320
You know, he's got like-

341
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Ping pong.

342
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Half a ping pong table where it's flipped up here.

343
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:20,720
He's got a computer that can only play League of Legends, he can only play ranked games,

344
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,600
and his teammates are always throwing.

345
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
You know what it should be?

346
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
If he hits-

347
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,420
And he has to do that for 25 straight years.

348
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,760
If he hits challenger, he gets out of jail.

349
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Yes.

350
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
That's crazy.

351
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,880
He's able to 1v5 solo carry a league ranked game.

352
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,200
If he hits challenger he gets the fuck out of it.

353
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,880
He can have all the hatch drugs he needs, all the caffeine he needs.

354
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,800
And if he loses they throw a tomato at him.

355
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Yeah.

356
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,000
Splatters it and it gets all in his...

357
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,400
And that's the only food he can have is the tomatoes.

358
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,560
Every time he loses he gets pelted with fruit.

359
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,440
One tomato thrown into this, or one food of whatever.

360
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,560
Okay, that's actually a good, this is a good punishment.

361
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,120
You can eat whatever gets thrown at you, but you get to choose the food.

362
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,860
So this guy's only eating soft foods.

363
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,760
He's going to be eating marshmallows for every meal.

364
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,720
Because nobody's going to order a T-bone steak if they have to have it thrown at their head

365
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,160
by like a MLB pitcher.

366
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
Right.

367
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,240
So he's going to be eating not that well, unless every once in a while maybe he'll decide

368
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,600
to take a maybe like a like a crustini or something to the face to see if that I

369
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,360
would take a steak to the head probably what would you do no I don't think you

370
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,840
want that would you eat a steak that hit your head yeah your head is disgusting

371
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,840
now my head's clean I think I look at this I wouldn't like to this literally

372
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:57,600
looks like the happy merchant racist pull me. Also this guy on the right what's his deal

373
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:05,600
the security guard. Yeah like this is bullshit. Destroying shit has to be outlawed. We need

374
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,560
to put every artist in jail. It's so funny. That is not right. Someone's job is to capture

375
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,840
pivotal moments in a court case by sketch.

376
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,280
And just try so hard to not be racist.

377
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,280
There was only a picture that they could take, a snapshot of a moment in time.

378
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,040
Some sort of device that was able to capture accurately reality from one moment.

379
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,680
I think at this point we're too far gone.

380
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,120
Let's do away with the drawings.

381
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,720
Let's not even do pictures.

382
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,200
Let's have it all be on TikTok live.

383
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Yeah.

384
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Okay.

385
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,320
And the accuser has to be like NPC.

386
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Yes.

387
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,320
At the end.

388
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Yeah.

389
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Yeah.

390
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,880
Your honor, my defendant, ice cream so good.

391
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,880
Ice cream so good.

392
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Yummy.

393
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Yummy.

394
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,880
Yummy.

395
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
I think that's a good idea.

396
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,520
I think that's a good idea.

397
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,440
I was talking about this yesterday.

398
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,280
I would do so good in white collar prison.

399
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,320
Why would you do? I don't think you can do good or bad. I mean, it's just it's just chill

400
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,240
It is shit. I would be listen

401
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:23,520
I would be telling all the like guys that have been in there since 2008. I would be hanging out with birdie Manoff

402
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,640
If he was still alive

403
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:32,320
I would be telling them about all the types of scams they can run when they come out and they would treat me as a god

404
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,120
You sucked

405
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,940
Now they've made like there's another way. Yeah, you're small fucking potatoes, but they would think why would I have they would think you were

406
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,200
So what I do?

407
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:51,920
Would think you were new Jack dude, you'd show up and you'd be like, yeah, I still I embezzled a hundred thousand dollars

408
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:58,440
Clean it's from crypto and they say first of all, what the fuck is crypto man. I've been here 15 years

409
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,120
I don't know what the hell you're on about

410
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,440
Number two a thousand dollar hundred thousand dollars is nothing to me

411
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,480
That's poop to me if I fucking chose to actually commit financial crimes, which I haven't

412
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,960
The option is there I could do it. I would be amazing at it, but I have

413
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,840
You think it'd be amazing at it, what does that mean you think you can get away with it

414
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,840
Do you know how smart I am?

415
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,320
Do you know how I know?

416
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,480
You are and that makes me think that you would not be very good

417
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,740
(laughing)

418
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,800
- But what was the one thing, this one time I remember,

419
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,520
he like called me or like messaged me

420
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,660
like fucking like five in the morning.

421
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,860
He was like, "Hey."

422
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,760
And I was like, "What do you want?"

423
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,560
Like I saw it like hours later,

424
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,000
I was like, "What is your problem?"

425
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,640
And I was like, "Oh, I saw that the episode got posted

426
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,240
"for the podcast, so I thought you were up."

427
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,900
I was like, "I don't hit posts at five in the morning

428
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,720
"every single day, I schedule those."

429
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,560
So you know--

430
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,520
- He's the most technologically literate man on earth.

431
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,880
I messaged you while you were away from the computer.

432
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
At 5 in the morning.

433
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Something that's never happened.

434
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,240
Okay, I didn't think you were awake.

435
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,240
I just messaged you.

436
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,240
This is it.

437
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
This is it.

438
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Well you did say, I thought you were awake.

439
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,240
You're on a T-sline.

440
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Well his dick is awake.

441
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,240
He's on discord.

442
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
It's also my, it's my time.

443
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,240
Please.

444
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
I leave my computer on sometimes.

445
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,440
I schedule the episodes.

446
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,840
And you message me at 5 in the morning.

447
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Hey, are you awake?

448
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,120
I just saw you posted the episode.

449
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,640
I saw the episode get posted and you were green on Discord.

450
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,520
I think that you would be, Rex, I believe that you would be pretty good, maybe great, at stealing

451
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,520
the money.

452
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,960
I think that you might be the worst at covering your tracks of anybody in the universe.

453
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,240
Yeah, and that's why I wouldn't do it.

454
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
I think you would open up the-

455
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,720
I would let the record show that I do not do financial crimes.

456
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,840
You would turn on your webcam to record this podcast and there would be $50 million stacked

457
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
up behind you.

458
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
In coins.

459
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,680
Yeah, in coins, overflowing out of mugs.

460
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
There would be-

461
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,640
You would look in my little 8x10 office and it would be turned into a Scrooge McDuck style

462
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,640
swimming pool of enemies.

463
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,640
Yes.

464
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,200
Just a poor website with a money sign on it.

465
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
Yeah.

466
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
It would be really bad, I think.

467
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,760
I think you'd be really, really bad at that part.

468
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,320
You'd get caught almost immediately.

469
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,280
Well, that's the thing.

470
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
You cannot get away with financial crimes.

471
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,520
It will eventually catch up to you.

472
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,320
I think the only one that works is if you do one of those crazy crypto hacks and then you

473
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
just disappear.

474
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,700
You pay to be disappeared.

475
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,840
I think you could do it.

476
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,260
I think you could get away with that shit.

477
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
You can't.

478
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
I am telling you.

479
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,300
How do they find you?

480
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,560
It's impossible to turn it into real money.

481
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,280
Not if you know some guy who does that.

482
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,600
No, there's no one who does that.

483
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,120
literally feds all the way down. It's impossible to get away with financial crimes. It's harder

484
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,520
to get away with financial crimes in crypto than it is in real money.

485
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,880
Do you think it's easier to rob a bank than get away with a crypto crime of an equal amount,

486
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
say you're stealing $500,000?

487
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,480
It'll take longer, but if you get away with a bank heist and you get home and you do the

488
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,840
money and you do what you need to do, the heat will be off of you, you'll be fine.

489
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,400
You're gonna fuck the money what are you saying? Well like, you know wash the money

490
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,800
Like

491
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:39,120
Cleaning business and you know legalize the money that way but like after like a month you're good

492
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,200
You know with a crypto crime there. They'll catch you like two years later and throw you a check. I

493
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
Guess you're right is the I know

494
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,920
Is that an official like an official thing like after a month they're like, all right, we're gonna stop looking now pretty much

495
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,200
I mean there is a statute of limitations on gta type type shit robbing a bank right there has to be yeah

496
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,880
Well, it's like the once the trail it's like murder once the trail goes cold

497
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,160
It's hard to reopen like most cold cases don't get solved. So if you get away

498
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,960
It's pretty much done

499
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,360
my buddy gus who i'm uh

500
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,320
doing a two shows with in Los Angeles on November 17th everybody go check out the tickets for that

501
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,760
there won't be a link for it there will completely be a link i forgot to put the link on the previous

502
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:31,400
episode i just okay you're ruining you're ruining my entire life anyway my buddy Gus his entire family

503
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,640
is from Charlestown Massachusetts that's where uh the town is that movie takes place it's all

504
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,360
bankrupt he's opening a second one oh my god he loves this beer so much i've never seen him do

505
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:50,360
do that before 30 minutes. That might actually be a two million. His uncles were all like

506
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:55,880
bank robbers and his mom was sitting on the couch when she was a kid with her mom and

507
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,960
they were watching the news and the news was like, "Another bank robbery in Charlestown

508
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,720
today. The suspect has been described as 5'11" and wearing a red tracksuit." And like right

509
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,940
as they said that, his uncle ran in the front door wearing a red tracksuit and a big bag

510
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
of money.

511
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,440
That's like the beginning to a slot bonus.

512
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,680
And Gus's grandma was like, "Get the fuck out of my house, I never want to see you again."

513
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,800
And he ran and he went to Florida and he died.

514
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Well how did he, did he die?

515
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Of old age.

516
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
Died of old age.

517
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
the

518
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
the

519
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,800
the

520
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
the

521
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,800
the

522
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
the

523
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
the

524
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,800
the

525
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,800
the

526
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,800
the

527
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
the

528
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,800
the

529
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
the

530
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
the

531
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,300
50 years ago, I can't believe that not everybody was doing

532
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,720
stuff like bank robberies.

533
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,380
- I think you would die a lot.

534
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,880
- I think you, it was too much effort.

535
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,780
It's still too much effort.

536
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:16,620
It's always been too much effort to grow a bank.

537
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,140
How would you do it?

538
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,980
Do it.

539
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,060
- Back in the day?

540
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,480
- Yeah, you are in the '80s.

541
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,660
Back in the day.

542
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,020
- I'm in the 1980s.

543
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,980
I would walk into the bank dressed as,

544
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,340
like Metal Gear Solid, I would be a walking trash can

545
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,860
or a traffic cone.

546
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,600
And I would just slowly waddle, every couple hours,

547
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,460
I would waddle like another couple of feet.

548
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,780
I'd be in there for days just waddling.

549
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,660
Just barely moving, just inching ever so forward.

550
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
- Inching out of everyone's vision cone?

551
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,100
- Yeah, exactly.

552
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,460
And then I would open up the vault

553
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,260
and I'd get all the money.

554
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,860
(laughing)

555
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,700
- Yeah.

556
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,340
- And how do you leave?

557
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,580
- Just start inching my way back.

558
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,820
All right, and they would be like,

559
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,580
oh my God, the money's gone!

560
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,660
Wait, we got robbed!

561
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,460
Wait, where is the bastard?

562
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,820
The last place you're gonna look

563
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,100
is the trash can or the traffic cone.

564
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,460
- That is true.

565
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,300
- That's been moving-- - Just saying, you guys.

566
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,400
- To the bank for a month.

567
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,500
- Just saying, guys.

568
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,980
Or I dress up like a guy, like a Brinks truck,

569
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,980
and I show up, and I say,

570
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,480
"Yeah, we gotta make a...

571
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,680
"We gotta deliver this shit to a Chinese restaurant down the street."

572
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,180
"How are you gonna dress up as a Brinks truck?"

573
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,880
"You need the truck first, first of all."

574
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,680
"I just get... I get an ice cream truck, I paint it grey."

575
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
"Yep."

576
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
"This is easy."

577
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,580
"People don't know that... Yeah, spray paint the ice cream truck."

578
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
"I show up, I'm wearing my Sunday best."

579
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,880
"I'm probably wearing this shirt."

580
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,280
"And I say, 'Listen guys, I'm gonna need...

581
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,380
$100 because I have to deliver it to people down the street.

582
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,420
They're not going to say no. They're not going to be like, Oh, what's, what,

583
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,420
what's your badge number? It's a hundred bucks. Yeah.

584
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,660
And I'll do that like a thousand times. I'll make a hundred grand. Okay.

585
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:09,100
Here's the thing. And this is, this is true for any financial crime.

586
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,740
Any financial crime puts you in jail for 25 years.

587
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,700
So you need to make a million dollars per year for it to be worth it

588
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
per year of prison.

589
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,060
And you have to do it when you're real...

590
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,060
See, the thing is, if you rob $25 million when you're one year old,

591
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,060
you get out in your mid-20s, you're having the most amazing mid-20s ever.

592
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
You just hide the money real well.

593
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
Yeah.

594
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,060
I, uh...

595
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,060
Crime is...

596
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Financial crimes are just one of those things where it's like,

597
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:44,060
if you're really good at it, you can make so much money.

598
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,060
That's what I would do, man.

599
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Yeah.

600
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
I would...

601
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:52,660
There's another guys that got arrested for financial crimes.

602
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:56,260
The people are saying is that one account, the like...

603
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,060
Yeah, I saw that.

604
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,460
And it's like what they did is they just opened up a thousand brokerage accounts

605
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:07,260
and then did like a fast transfer of $5,000

606
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:12,860
and then like buy some like random stock or like stock option

607
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,260
and then buy the reverse of it on a different account

608
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:22,380
And then just lose $5,000 and then it just never like the transfer never comes through and they did that like a thousand

609
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:26,300
And they made like two million dollars. They made like nothing

610
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,340
And they're going to jail for 25 years

611
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:35,020
Here's what I would do. That's like how much you would make if you worked at mcdonald's for no, it's not the money

612
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,180
It's just the the twitter guy the the craziest moments in new metal history

613
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,260
Yeah, I would do that something like that something really simple

614
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,580
but I would have a

615
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,780
child a daughter because they go easier on daughters on true women and I would

616
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:55,340
say the baby did it penned it on the baby no and then the baby again baby goes to

617
00:30:55,340 --> 00:31:07,180
jail for 25 years I visit charge the baby as a kid so it goes to you know who

618
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:13,780
tried that the guy who came up with the first like hack for slot machines like

619
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:19,780
physical slot machine. He said a baby did it? He like hinted on his like 14 year old daughter.

620
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:27,940
I can't believe someone's actually tried the baby did it. Yeah no he did it on like like a young

621
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:34,740
girl like his young girl daughter. And it worked right? Uh no it did not. Really? Yeah. Why?

622
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:42,180
Because it was obviously that it was him. Yeah. They put his whole family in jail. It works with

623
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:57,180
the

624
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:11,420
a

625
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:18,100
Think it might work. Yeah, I think every time has ever that's ever been possible to do is has already been done

626
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,320
I think I think the crime industry is stale

627
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:28,340
I think that you are ripe to be framed for a crime because again, you don't do that much during the day. Not that many

628
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,760
Excuses not not many alibis have been created

629
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,560
Alibis, I've got my most of my day is tracked in some sort of database

630
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,300
uh... on either open you do you or

631
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,320
lol chest dot

632
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,500
dot com

633
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,020
you know fortunately

634
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,140
so i've got a good i got out of ice

635
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,420
and how allies

636
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:55,620
i do you think you could pin a murder on the baby

637
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,620
all like a

638
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,580
the baby was running around with a gun

639
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:03,820
didn't realize it was i think you can get charged for that

640
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:06,780
It's probably less than if you actually murdered someone.

641
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,340
Uhhhh...

642
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,380
I guess.

643
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,380
I think it depends on the murder weapon.

644
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,420
Sledgehammer? No way.

645
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:19,900
Well, like, what if it was like a knife and your wife fell on the baby,

646
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:23,420
almost crushing the baby and the knife, and it just so happened to slide perfectly?

647
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
And it's her fault.

648
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,740
Exactly!

649
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,420
Yeah, you had nothing to do with it.

650
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,060
Right.

651
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
What, I'm not supposed to...

652
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,060
Who's trying to teach the baby to cook?

653
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,540
...stop my wife from using a knife?

654
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,340
Yeah.

655
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,080
what if you do the thing where you

656
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,280
to gather this baby's hand you grab the knife with the baby's hand and the you

657
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,980
that's what i'm saying

658
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,020
uh...

659
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,660
uh... yeah it was him that it was the airplane

660
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:50,020
yeah yeah four thousand times you know you know what you're on monday you man

661
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,660
but uh... i

662
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,580
what the hell

663
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,020
that's the baby goes to jail

664
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,740
one-year

665
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,100
i think i would be fine to the bayside you remember jail

666
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,220
also again they probably won't put it in what if there was a baby jail

667
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,900
i mean i've been saying this for a very long time there should be because that's

668
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,780
what when whenever kids are uh... you know me i don't believe in abortion i

669
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:16,460
think that this is murder so i think of the all children should be born and then

670
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,580
put directly in jail

671
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,340
okay

672
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,580
you know they they're birthed and then to just directly to jail get out of my site

673
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:28,820
don't need to see it what if i do think it's going to uh...

674
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:32,740
- What if they do like the pet adoption thing with babies?

675
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,180
And it's like, all right, every baby goes into a thing

676
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,300
and they have to get adopted

677
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,500
and you gotta pay 60 bucks for them.

678
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,180
And you get like a kit.

679
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,060
- That's what it is, that's already what they do.

680
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,380
- That's not what they do.

681
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,380
- Yeah.

682
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,520
- Imagine a one year old with a swastika forehead tattoo.

683
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,760
- Yeah, see, I mean, again,

684
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,300
I don't give a fuck about these babies who are unwanted.

685
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,260
- You don't give a fuck about these babies?

686
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,560
- No, I'm putting my hand off screen.

687
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,260
I don't give a fuck about these babies that are,

688
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:05,260
see

689
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:08,700
no no and thing like that

690
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,940
if the baby it listen i don't i think it shouldn't be

691
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,820
uh... religiously murdered

692
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,980
that the met style in an operating room at uh... uh...

693
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,220
play what i call that complain genocides that's what i call

694
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,180
i do think that these babies don't matter at all and they should be put in

695
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,260
some kind of

696
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,740
correctional facility.

697
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,860
'Cause what's the problem with unwanted children?

698
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,140
What's the big problem with it?

699
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,140
They all turn out to be drug addicts and drug dealers.

700
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,980
- Right.

701
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,260
- If a baby's unwanted, they grow up

702
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,020
and they become despicable crime people.

703
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,660
- Despicable Me grew.

704
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,900
- Despicable Me grew, grew was supposed to be, yeah.

705
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,540
He was an unwanted pregnancy.

706
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,940
- Right. - So,

707
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,100
just put 'em in there early.

708
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,700
They're gonna end up there anyway, man.

709
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,500
Just get that baby in jail, let's forget about it.

710
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,740
- I think this is making a lot of sense to me.

711
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,780
What?

712
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,240
- This country should be 40% jail.

713
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,580
- I agree, what are we at, like 10% right now?

714
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,420
- Yeah.

715
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,240
- These would be way higher.

716
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,700
- Let's bump those numbers up.

717
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,700
- I don't think that they would put me in jail

718
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,620
just for being not white.

719
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,940
And that's not right.

720
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,300
- Okay, but you are white.

721
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,500
- That's not right.

722
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,900
- I think that-- - Every time I get

723
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,900
racially profiled--

724
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,460
- Every time I go through TSA,

725
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,420
They're like, "Yo, search him."

726
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,740
- I don't think that's ever happened to you.

727
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,340
- I got randomly searched every single time at TSA.

728
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,180
- Here's what I think.

729
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,100
- Where are you going?

730
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,820
Where are you going, kid?

731
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,020
- They're just asking you a question to be nice

732
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,260
and you're taking it.

733
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,100
- No.

734
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,020
- Also, for the record,

735
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:43,180
your two interactions with the police,

736
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,580
you were so nice to them that you invited them inside.

737
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,420
- Wow.

738
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,820
- For no reason to just hang out with them.

739
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,620
- They were profiling me, bro.

740
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,340
They were profiling me and I was like, "Yes!"

741
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,540
I was in my house, they were probably making time out of my house

742
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,740
They came all the way out of the-

743
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,940
is it airbnb and you let them in you're not supposed to let them in dude they

744
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,420
have a vampire law they call it that you don't have to let them in if a cop shows

745
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:10,300
up and says i need i need sugar for a cake that i'm baking you don't have to

746
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,260
let them in bro he literally it's like the two minutes i leave the house i

747
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,740
leave him alone the cops come because they know me it's a long-haired

748
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,940
degenerate on himself yeah he called them up to ask what they were doing said

749
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,420
he was home alone and the cop over

750
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,540
what's your emergency?

751
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,380
I'm Mexican and they showed up

752
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,300
yeah and

753
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:35,100
now you got some poor landlord in trouble

754
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,340
yeah

755
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,500
just because he had a poison house

756
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,380
still in trouble by the way

757
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,220
yeah he still has that that fucking thing

758
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,580
is still hanging up in the

759
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,500
you literally ruined that guy's life

760
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,380
they completely banned airbnbs off at New York City

761
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,900
and some people are saying

762
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,100
it's not because of me

763
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,620
because of you, you ruined everybody's trip

764
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,980
literally because of you

765
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,180
It is 100% your fault.

766
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
It's unreal, man.

767
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,180
You literally let them in for no reason.

768
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,180
Because you can't say no to a cop.

769
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,180
I'm actually busy, can you come back later?

770
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,180
It's just my southern hospitality, man.

771
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,180
You are southern.

772
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Southern of the border.

773
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,180
What can I say?

774
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,180
I was just too nice.

775
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,180
I just can't hate.

776
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,180
I don't have a single hate particle in my society.

777
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,180
Here's what I would have said.

778
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,180
Knock on the door.

779
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:28,180
the

780
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:43,660
the

781
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:58,340
for

782
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,000
they'd be out of there, dude.

783
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,040
They would be running away from me, bro.

784
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,140
I'm a walk-in lawsuit.

785
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,740
I'm a liability to these cops.

786
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,720
- Right.

787
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,480
- They do not wanna see me.

788
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,440
- You and Julio are the polar opposites

789
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
of dealing with the police.

790
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,440
You trolled the Boston FBI by playing Kevin Rudolph

791
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,200
and Juvio invited them inside

792
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,480
and asked if they needed water or lemonade.

793
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,240
- I'm not a troll.

794
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,440
I'm not a troll.

795
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
I post on Facebook.

796
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,760
I go, "Hey, guys." - "Do you have food?"

797
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,320
This is what I have for breakfast.

798
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,840
This is my life, my awesome life.

799
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,880
I don't troll, I don't post jokes.

800
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,940
- What can I say, bro?

801
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,200
I'm a fucking troll to the death of me, bro.

802
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,200
My DNA, if you zoom into it,

803
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
it would literally be troll faces.

804
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:47,200
That's the level of troll that I am, okay?

805
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,920
And so even more so than being at all political,

806
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,320
I don't care about what the cops do,

807
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,360
it's none of my business.

808
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,440
But I see, they walk around and I see marks,

809
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,040
I see perfect green victims that I could just destroy.

810
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,840
And what do you troll at the top of the street?

811
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,320
I'd say, "Oh, uh, police officer, police officer, there's a bomb in my hand.

812
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
Oh my god, there's a bomb!"

813
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,920
They'd say, "Oh my god!"

814
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,200
It's counting down, "5, 4, 3, 2..."

815
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,040
Oh, but it says you actually have a bomb.

816
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,040
I have a bomb.

817
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,040
I'd say, "Oh, there's a bomb!

818
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
There's a bomb in my hand!"

819
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,360
And they're freaking out, they're pulling their gun on me, and I say, "I don't know how to

820
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
turn it off!"

821
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,360
"5, 4, 3, 2, 1, beep, beep, beep!"

822
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,360
And then it goes

823
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:34,120
We're the strangers to love and I sit there and I dance that shit I twerk on the cop car which I think is okay

824
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,680
That's what I would have done man

825
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,280
That's what I would do I would do that shit

826
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,240
Don't give a fuck if I get shot that's part of the trolling

827
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:54,520
Exactly

828
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,800
Straight up. They wouldn't shoot me man. They would say my bald brother. How did you get off the force?

829
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,600
Mm-hmm. Are you a plainclothes officer? I would say yeah, dude, and I have this bomb

830
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:07,360
But you're gonna have to take this shit off my hands. I was gonna want this bomb anymore

831
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:14,240
Homeless black guy on the train and he kept looking at me and calling me an undercover cop and I was like in what world

832
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,020
Do I look like an undercover cop? I should be kind of short Jewish

833
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,880
Wait, do you think have you?

834
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,880
It's since you you've got the glasses. Do you think you've getting more negative interactions with strangers?

835
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,460
You're I don't wear them outside. It seems that as you are

836
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:38,440
Why not because it looks stupid no

837
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,440
I don't. I'm gonna lose you.

838
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,440
That's hurtful!

839
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,440
I spent so much money on these!

840
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,440
They don't look stupid.

841
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,440
I was just asking if that's why, because maybe you think they look stupid.

842
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,440
I think they look amazing!

843
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,440
I think you look like a rockstar from the 70s or 80s.

844
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,440
I think you do!

845
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
You look like an artist, dude.

846
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,440
You don't look stupid at all.

847
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,440
I wear them so that I can look at the computer better.

848
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,760
You don't look like a substitute teacher at a Quaker school even a little bit to me man.

849
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,840
I think that these are cool glasses, you need to wear them outside more.

850
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,320
You need to gain a little confidence.

851
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:21,520
You need to wear them outside more and see what happens.

852
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,680
Why would I wear them outside?

853
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,280
What am I looking at outside?

854
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,360
The world?

855
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,520
The beauty of the world?

856
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,540
I don't need to see that well outside.

857
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,360
I'm not driving.

858
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,360
You bet you're walking.

859
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,480
Yeah, but I can see perfectly fine now.

860
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,720
I could come up behind you and kill you and the glasses would do nothing how it

861
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,840
is you would see them if somebody tried to tried to stab you in the eye the

862
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,120
glasses would block it Wow now you feel like a stupid asshole don't you feel

863
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:56,600
like it's stupid do you know and scan everything around you every single time

864
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,320
the only time I wore them out was for Halloween and you were dressed up as

865
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,660
Peter Griffin when I was dressed up as Peter Griffin. Do you have a picture? No

866
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,400
It was a pretty weak costume. It was definitely a thrown together. What's in the

867
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,400
Was it a better or worse Peter Griffin than Mike's that one day?

868
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,000
It was worse Mike Mike dresses like Peter Griffin all the time

869
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,040
I cut up to a Airbnb this one like the first time I ever met him

870
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,760
You know your shows up to our Airbnb and I go like oh my I walk outside. I look at him like oh my god

871
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,320
He's so tall. Hello. Hi Mike. Nice to meet you come and send her poison Airbnb

872
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,680
He comes inside he's just hanging out with us and then Rex just like looks at him once and he's like

873
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:48,160
Like look this is you

874
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,480
Yeah, it's really sad. That's like in Peter Griffin man. The problem is that I don't own a white button-down shirt

875
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,920
Just straight up. That's a

876
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,120
Essential men's wardrobe man. It's not either. No one owns that I have one is exactly what he looked like. Yeah

877
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:14,080
Like literally exactly what he looked like, yeah

878
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,620
I thought about shaving and kind of drawing the balls on my chin

879
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:22,840
Why do you do that?

880
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,520
I was lazy

881
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
No, that would mean good. Yeah

882
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,600
Wait, Halloween update. Where's your drink? Halloween update. What are you drinking?

883
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,300
Okay, hold on. I have to get another hoppy refresher. Hold on.

884
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,000
So...

885
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,500
You give me your Halloween update then.

886
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,500
I didn't do anything on Halloween night, but on Saturday...

887
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:48,000
We went to a party at Patch's house.

888
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,500
Okay.

889
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,000
And it was lit AF.

890
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
*burp*

891
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,840
uh...

892
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,180
and i

893
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,280
mhm

894
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,440
took too many sins and throughout

895
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:10,080
he did in the in the middle of talking to me and and tommy bayer

896
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:13,560
he he he was a little bit and then what

897
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,400
and i had he erection behind me so i didn't really knows going on and tommy

898
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,600
was telling a story

899
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,780
and he's like you had in this

900
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,520
did you just throw up no yes if i spit

901
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,120
Oh, he said, "Did you just spit?"

902
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,120
Yeah, "Did you just spit?"

903
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
And you said, "Yes."

904
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,360
No, you said, "No, I threw up."

905
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Yeah.

906
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,960
And, uh, it was really, really making us laugh.

907
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,560
And you looked psychotically happy.

908
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,320
It was like the happiest I've ever seen you be.

909
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,880
I felt so much better after throwing up.

910
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,600
You threw up in the middle of a conversation and then just went right back to it.

911
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:52,840
So, okay, for reference, we were outside sitting on a bench and behind the bench was like staggered

912
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:59,280
bushes and so I was sitting behind Caleb Tommy was sitting in front of Caleb mm-hmm

913
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:09,640
and in the middle of that I leaned over threw up once leaned back and then just

914
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:16,840
one back over and threw up again quite a bit. You one tapped the puke? No no I had to

915
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,240
double tap it and really it was a triple tap because the second time was longer

916
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,920
and Tommy because of how he was sitting he just saw me lean over and something

917
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,580
maybe come out of my mouth a little bit or just like you know the impression

918
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:37,160
that I had spit and he's like well what did you just do I was like oh I threw up

919
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,680
and then Rex acted like we were making a big deal out of it I mean you were it

920
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,800
wasn't a big deal at all. You threw up in the middle of a conversation! Go to the bathroom!

921
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,800
Is this your first time talking to Tommy?

922
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,800
Yeah, it was the first time.

923
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,800
He met him 20 minutes into the meeting and he threw up twice.

924
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
Yeah.

925
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,800
And acted like nothing happened.

926
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,800
I think it would make a big deal if I was there.

927
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
I would be like, "Whoa, what the fuck? Are you okay, man?"

928
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,800
No one saw it except for Brian and Tommy.

929
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,800
And Caleb.

930
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,800
No, Caleb didn't see it.

931
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,800
My back was to him.

932
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:21,000
I knew that he had had a recent string of throwing up.

933
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,760
Yeah, it just felt great to get it out.

934
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,000
I felt horrible in the lead up to the throw up, and then throwing up made me feel great.

935
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,640
And then I felt, I was still kind of drunk.

936
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,040
I had nicotine in my body.

937
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
I felt good.

938
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,400
It got you to the perfect cross section of every intoxicant.

939
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,260
Yeah, exactly.

940
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:45,780
And then I ate Taco Bell later and I felt literally perfect.

941
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,780
I love Taco Bell.

942
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,780
Dude, what are we doing for Drinksgiving?

943
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:49,780
Oh my god.

944
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,780
Drinksgiving!

945
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,780
Guys, guys, official update.

946
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,260
We gotta do some kind of pumpkin ale.

947
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:58,860
Drinksgiving we are doing a big IRL recording.

948
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:01,220
It's gonna be the three of us.

949
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,220
It's gonna be Alex.

950
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,340
It's gonna be Noah maybe.

951
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,180
It's gonna be Brian maybe.

952
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:10,820
And that's it maybe.

953
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:14,540
everyone will be what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna have to get like an

954
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:21,660
analog for every popular Thanksgiving food mmm we'll have to get the beer

955
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:28,260
version like the turkey beer all of this we're gonna have to get all of them and

956
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,260
you're going to have to make a plate just like you would at a normal

957
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,060
Thanksgiving and I have a strong feeling what some people's will look like but

958
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:40,020
you're gonna have to do yeah one of each of one serving of each of these beers

959
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:47,020
and

960
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:55,020
I think this is a good idea. We're gonna do yeah, honey glazed ham beer green bean casserole beer pumpkin pie mashed potatoes turkey

961
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,200
We'll figure it out once we go to the beer store, but I'm sure that they have all those there

962
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,740
Those are just Joan's soda flavors. I don't know what we would do for beer

963
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,500
we will

964
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:11,260
Spike them we will find something. I'm feeling pretty confident or we'll have Noah make mixology style

965
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,900
Something that tastes like each of them. I think Noah could easily poison us and we could just have the most fucked up episode of all time

966
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,300
That's fine by me man. That's fine by me now that I'm doing I mean listen

967
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,860
I really miss now that I'm doing this sober gopher stint and

968
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:35,760
My gophers know this when I am NOT doing a gopher episode. I like that the episode gets slowly worse

969
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,200
Because as we as we get more drunk and more drunk right that that's better

970
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,880
Than it being kind of just evenly good the entire way

971
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,840
I like when it starts the first 15 minutes we come out come out blazing right?

972
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:55,000
I mean the first beer is done. I'm starting to feel sick to my stomach. I hate shit so much

973
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,500
Can't believe I do a beer podcast. It's complete. It's literal poison. Yeah, and then

974
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,160
You know

975
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,160
on fries and everything.

976
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,160
Yeah, poutine based on...

977
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,160
The slip ups that come out...

978
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,160
The slip ups that come out are...

979
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:13,160
are...

980
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,160
I miss that.

981
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,160
There's no way that you cannot get a single thing of poutine in the entirety of New York.

982
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,160
You can.

983
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,160
We'll get you poutine when you come here.

984
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,160
Don't even worry about it.

985
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,160
You wanted it, not me.

986
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:27,160
I like poutine, we'll get you some. Don't worry about it.

987
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,160
I don't want any of it.

988
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,160
I told Kale of this, I wanted to show you Rex.

989
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,380
I saw this video of this girl who went to follow the show

990
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:40,840
Touch a subject. I saw that video. Yeah, and she was there for fucking eight hours hours

991
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:45,880
Yeah, and they gave it to her for free. They come through from her meal what yeah

992
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,520
They have a time limit at Fogo

993
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:56,200
She hours she stayed the entire day. Yeah, they didn't take those from 2:30 to 530 for lunch to dinner

994
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,720
I don't think it was the New York City photo to tell there was another one. Yeah

995
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:07,720
Yeah, I think this was a different Fogo de Chao and she's a famous all-you-can-eat TikToker.

996
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,720
She have a big mouth?

997
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,720
I don't know about that.

998
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,720
I guess, yeah.

999
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,720
She doesn't look like she's way too happy about eating the food?

1000
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,720
No, no, that's a different person you're thinking.

1001
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Oh, okay.

1002
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
This is some random woman I'd never seen before.

1003
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Alright.

1004
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,720
But apparently the chefs knew who she was.

1005
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:30,560
she was, they brought out like a lobster tail for her in the middle of her meal.

1006
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,960
And then at the end she tried to sell her bill and they were like, no,

1007
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,720
we come to you. Thanks for coming.

1008
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:41,080
Dude. Wow. This is what I'm saying. This and also the, uh,

1009
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:44,920
I know you guys are not tuned in. I wish Patrick was here to, to see,

1010
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,240
to see this. I hope he's listening. The Keith Lee thing in Atlanta. He just,

1011
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,400
he went in, he went to Atlanta. He made a whole mess for my,

1012
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,320
about my thing, two restaurants, but everybody loves him.

1013
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:57,160
And he just goes to restaurants.

1014
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,280
- Who's Keith Lee?

1015
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,760
- He is a TikTok restaurant reviewer.

1016
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,940
We need to become food reviewers.

1017
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,120
We need to go to restaurants, eat the food,

1018
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,640
and go on social media and be like,

1019
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,760
"It's mad," and do that to every single restaurant.

1020
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,580
Go to McDonald's, this burger is mad,

1021
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:18,660
and we'll be so rich and so popular,

1022
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:21,400
and every single restaurant will respect us crazy,

1023
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,240
crazy style.

1024
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,240
Holy shit. This is my idea

1025
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,720
Keith Lee

1026
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,100
It's on CNN Keith Lee tried to review some Atlanta restaurants on tick-tock all hell broke loose

1027
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:36,280
This is what I'm saying. It was literally news Christ. We can do this

1028
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:43,360
We please take food reviews expose Atlanta's odd dining rules, yep

1029
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:50,380
This is national news is on The Washington Post. We can do this. Mikhail Klementov wrote this article really

1030
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,220
(laughing)

1031
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:53,300
- Yeah, Keith Lee praised by fans

1032
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,060
for his honest, humble food reviews.

1033
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,180
This is Mike's words.

1034
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,600
Echoed residents distaste for $1 butter,

1035
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:02,460
odd dining rules, and lack of go-to ordering.

1036
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,780
- By the way, this is the writer of that article.

1037
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:09,000
This is Mikhail Klementov right here on your screens,

1038
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,180
dressed as Peter Griffin,

1039
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,380
in front of a picture of a Peter Griffin.

1040
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:15,980
- And then now he's covering this whole Keith Lee drama.

1041
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,420
- That's crazy. - That is true.

1042
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:18,340
- Well, that's interesting.

1043
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:20,940
Yeah, I mean, I would love to, I will say,

1044
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,820
I think I would be a little bit insulted

1045
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,500
if I went into a restaurant and the chefs recognized me.

1046
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,900
That would make me feel fat.

1047
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,700
No, it's more of a fame thing.

1048
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,540
Yeah, I know.

1049
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,060
That would make me feel really fat

1050
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,940
if chefs were like, we know who you are,

1051
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,900
we know how much you love food, here's a bunch of food.

1052
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,060
I'd go, hmm, what about me is telegraphing

1053
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:44,940
that I love food so much?

1054
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,940
I've never made a food TikTok in my life.

1055
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,940
What? No. What?

1056
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,940
That makes no sense.

1057
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:54,940
The gluttony theme just plays when you walk in.

1058
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,940
Yeah.

1059
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,940
Give me another bowl!

1060
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,940
Okay.

1061
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,940
Just give me some sandwiches!

1062
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,940
And any kind of other dishes. Is that what it is?

1063
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:11,940
I've tried to figure out what he's saying for the past day and a half and I can't.

1064
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:19,860
Yeah, we need somebody to be doing... we need a Rap Genius, a Genius.com, like, lyrics,

1065
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,900
deconstructed video for all the No Limit City Slot music.

1066
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:32,540
Yeah, I was listening to the, first of all, the Rock Bottom music.

1067
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:35,420
There's a song that plays when you get a max win.

1068
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,380
And then the Remember Gulag Extended mixes.

1069
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:41,620
They have an extended one?

1070
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:46,900
Oh, yeah. Oh my god. You just listen to this on your own time. Just like on your youtube music

1071
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,980
Yeah, yeah, they're good songs, man. They're good. Really good songs

1072
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:56,100
I think that they should be definitely up for there should be a best slot music grammy award

1073
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,340
Yeah, no, it's honestly it's really good music

1074
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:06,100
I think about the lyrics to gluttony to the super size me, baby

1075
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,960
Super size me, baby

1076
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:15,700
Yeah, we have to gamble tonight. Yeah, we do we have to we have it's it's said and it's done. It's going to happen

1077
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:23,020
I thought that you know, I had an idea. Is there any can you show nudity on kick calm? I believe so I

1078
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,420
think it's

1079
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,400
No, you really can't is there any website like that where you just straight-up show?

1080
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,060
Completely nudity

1081
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,980
I guess we could do porn up

1082
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:40,900
I want to do a live stream like money or movie Monday style thing where we watch that that naked dating show

1083
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:47,800
Hmm. Okay, I was talking to my wife about it last night and I and she was like, she's like, oh we can watch that

1084
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,300
I was like that shows for girls and then I talked about

1085
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:57,000
When I watched one episode of it and I talked about every guy's cock and I remembered their cock and balls

1086
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,020
Yeah, it's like yeah, it really sounds like it's for girls

1087
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,300
*laughter*

1088
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:03,800
BOOM!

1089
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,400
I was like, okay, first of all, bitch.

1090
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,420
Second of all, we have to watch this on some kind of stream.

1091
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:12,420
This is a great idea.

1092
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,420
Because it is for guys.

1093
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,420
She changed my mind.

1094
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,420
This is a show for guys.

1095
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,420
It is.

1096
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:17,420
I guess we could try doing it on a game.

1097
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:18,420
Here's the thing.

1098
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:26,380
As a man married to a woman, you know that if you remembered anything about the woman's

1099
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,300
vaginas or breasts, you would be in trouble.

1100
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,700
I'd be in jail.

1101
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,500
So you lock on to the cocks.

1102
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,020
I literally didn't even pay attention when the women were on.

1103
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,020
Wait, what is this?

1104
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,220
Can you go over what the show is?

1105
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,220
Sure.

1106
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:40,220
It's a show...

1107
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,700
You explain it.

1108
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:49,540
So it starts, they introduce a loser, a person who is actually retarded.

1109
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,540
They're British.

1110
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,540
It's a British show.

1111
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,540
So let's start with that.

1112
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,820
They've got fucked up teeth.

1113
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,340
They've got a weird life.

1114
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:57,780
They're really off-putting socially.

1115
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,380
And they talk about how they haven't been on a date in three years and their life sucks

1116
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:05,380
and they hope to find love on the naked dating show.

1117
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:10,700
And so they come in and they get introduced and then there are six colored pods in front

1118
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,700
of them.

1119
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:18,180
And in front of the pods is like a kind of a screen, if you will.

1120
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:26,380
And so it starts and the screen comes up to just above the genital area.

1121
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:33,620
So the only thing you can see of six people is their like either dick or pussy, their

1122
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:37,560
ass, their legs and their feet.

1123
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:39,420
And so like the other stuff, yeah.

1124
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:42,980
So there was one autistic guy that was like, those feet are disgusting.

1125
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,120
Get this bitch out of here.

1126
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,120
This is on TV.

1127
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,420
You can see the whole thing.

1128
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,960
There's seasons of it on max.

1129
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:54,740
It has 10 real seasons and six of them are on HBO right now.

1130
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:59,340
So then they kick one off based solely on genitals and they interview the person.

1131
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:05,100
There's always like a after interview where they have the person talk and they're always

1132
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:10,620
like yeah I feel really good you know I feel really confident in myself and despite the

1133
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:16,780
fact that someone took one look at their dick and said no.

1134
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,460
Yeah it is brutal man.

1135
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:23,020
Yeah so then and then if it's like the women they're like if it's women in the boxes they're

1136
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,180
like yeah show us your your pussy and asshole and then they ask about like

1137
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:30,700
pubic hair and the guys were like I had a bad experience with pubic hair so I

1138
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:38,260
don't like it. Then the next step is it goes up to like here so it shows like

1139
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:42,620
shoulders, breasts, everything but the head, mid torso, everything but the head.

1140
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:48,260
Right. And then you know if it's women it's like oh that one she's so

1141
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,300
interesting looking but I think she might be a little too curvy for me is

1142
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,580
Something they might say to be nice if it's the women they're like he looks

1143
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:59,100
Lanky and skinny that's not for me and get him the fuck out of here

1144
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,840
The women are really harsh and the men are like overly nice

1145
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:08,780
And then it goes and it shows they're like faces and they all look British as fuck. None of them are that good-looking

1146
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:14,940
the only people are the the guys who are like

1147
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:22,100
Immigrants from another country who live now live in the UK. Those are the only good-looking people in the entire show

1148
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:27,100
Everybody else, everybody from the UK are disgusting pigs.

1149
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,100
Yeah.

1150
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:34,100
So then, now looking at their whole body, whole naked body, they kick another person off.

1151
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:36,100
So they settle it down to three.

1152
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:40,100
Now, sometimes they'll get someone who's like bisexual.

1153
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:45,100
So by now they've completely eliminated the opposite gender that they don't care about.

1154
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:49,100
Whatever, whether, if it's a bi woman, they've either kicked off all the men or all the women.

1155
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:59,100
If there's a trans person, which it does happen, the trans person is always still in because they need to appear that they're considering it, but it will never actually be the final choice.

1156
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:03,100
And then, you know, just all the good things about it.

1157
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,100
Finally, down to three, they get to talk.

1158
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,100
So they ask a question. They say, "What don't you like about your body?"

1159
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:17,100
And if it's the women, they're like, "Oh, you know, I feel like my breasts aren't big enough, my arms are kind of flabby, my feet are weird."

1160
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,100
So I have a question.

1161
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,100
Sure.

1162
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:22,420
Is the chooser also naked?

1163
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,500
By the last stage they are.

1164
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,660
I'm getting to this.

1165
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:31,500
So they're fully clothed right now and then having answered this question they hear their

1166
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:35,340
voice and a lot of times they're like, "Yeah, he sounds like he's from Northampton Shire.

1167
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,860
I'm not really a fan of that accent."

1168
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Kick him off.

1169
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:38,860
Right.

1170
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:46,900
So now it's the turn where they send the picker back and they come back out naked and they

1171
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,740
walk and while they're waiting for the picker to come back out they have the

1172
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,800
two contestants usually two men right kind of look at each other waiting

1173
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,500
silently while their dicks are out and they go what do you think about his body

1174
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:05,740
and they kind of you know and like sometimes it'll be like a thin white guy

1175
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:09,940
next to a huge black guy to be like guy his cock is the size of my arm you know

1176
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,700
like fucking bullshit like that it's really awesome or like one time there's

1177
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:19,020
a big buff guy in like a little twink and the buff guy is like yeah he looks like

1178
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:24,300
he's really agile. Very kind thing to say. Yeah exactly they're always really nice to

1179
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:31,620
each other and then finally they narrow it down and then they pick one and

1180
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:41,460
then they go on the worst date of all time at 9 a.m. the next day. Yeah. So then they show

1181
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:47,140
like a conversation and then it shows them like two weeks to a month later and

1182
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:51,140
of course the relationship has completely fallen apart they're forced

1183
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:56,480
to sit on a couch and answer like how it went and at best they're like yeah we've

1184
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,520
texted a few times it's because this is the opposite they do the opposite of how

1185
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,540
you're supposed to see people right supposed to see face and then next step

1186
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,260
is you're supposed to see their naked torso and then only then should you be

1187
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:14,260
seeing people's the naughty parts of their body that I don't want to talk

1188
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:20,060
about. That is how it should be. That is why we invented clothing. It literally

1189
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:26,780
never works. My favorite is when one of the guys is like too good-looking for

1190
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:31,260
the girl and then it's always she's just like yeah he didn't call me after we had

1191
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:37,500
sex on the first date. It's awesome. It's a great show and we have to watch it together.

1192
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
It is literally the perfect TV show.

1193
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
Sounds thrilling.

1194
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
I think you'd really like it.

1195
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
We can do like a, we can watch a couple episodes

1196
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
and some sort of stream

1197
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
or somewhere not on Twitch.

1198
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Yeah. We'll figure it out.

1199
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
We'll figure it out.

1200
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,500
Oh, they also have like educational cutaways

1201
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,500
where they'll like ask a question

1202
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,500
and they'll be like, "Yeah, what do you think of her like

1203
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
uh, pussy hair?"

1204
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
And he'll be like, "Yeah, that's fucking disgusting."

1205
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
And then it's like,

1206
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:11,260
to do you know like fucking bullshit drawings and it's like 97% of british men say pubic hair is

1207
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:17,900
disgusting it's really it's really got to be one of the worst shows ever made but guys we're gonna
