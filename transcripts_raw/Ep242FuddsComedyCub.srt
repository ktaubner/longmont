1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
You're a real puppy dog.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,040
- Hey, who you calling puppy dog over here?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,520
I'm a big dog.

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm a full grown adult.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,900
- Wow, what a terrific audience.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,040
(audience applauding)

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,000
- Thank you so much.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
- Hello everybody and welcome to the open mic.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,240
Your first comedian is Caleb Pitts.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
- Woo!

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:49,300
Hey guys, what's up everybody? Okay, I'm 15 years old and I'm fucking clueless.

13
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,780
Pretty much the title LMFAO. I have no idea if these jokes are appropriate for

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,860
my first open mic. Criticism not just welcomed but invited. I'm looking to

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:05,860
improve, not impress TBH. Here are my jokes. Teenage activists, you know them,

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,360
always parading their views about issues such as climate change and LGBT rights.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,740
They love saying that they want their voice to be heard. I understand their

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,800
point completely. It can be hard to speak very loud when I'm throttling them to

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:26,580
death for being annoying cunts. As I'm sure you can tell, I'm extremely new to

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,780
new to performing comedy. Well, to be fair, I'm pretty new to living at the

21
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,540
age of fifteen.

22
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:40,460
That's beside the point. All I ask of you is, please, can I have no heckling

23
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,020
or jeering throughout this set? And in the words of my maths teacher, please

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,340
don't make me run out the room crying with six flesh wounds this time.

25
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:54,780
I believe that TikTok and other apps that give you instant gratification in

26
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,380
short burts are ruining my generation's attention span. It's gotten so bad that

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,780
they can't go five minutes without losing interest

28
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,580
stairs out into the distance. Oh wow, that was pretty good. Yeah, wow, I kind

29
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,900
of like that one. That one gets a wow from us.

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,660
Have you ever stopped to think why exactly my generation is called generation

31
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:17,980
Z?

32
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,460
I'm starting to think it might be because they saw us with our tick tock and our

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,960
pronouns and thought this is it end of the line for humanity. Let's get to Z

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,520
the end of the alphabet.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:39,000
I've been told by many people from the older generation that all the rap music

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,260
I listen to sounds the same. I'm assuming this is because without their

37
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,060
hearing aids, everything sounds silent.

38
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,460
No, you can't boo me. You cannot boo me. Okay.

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,740
I take the bus to school every day. I don't know what it used to be like,

40
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,260
but these days every single person on the bus is looking on their phone.

41
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,540
Well,

42
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,500
that stopped last week when the bus driver has drove us off a cliff after being

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
distracted on Instagram. Okay.

44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,140
The dog is talking to the microphone.

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,860
He keeps growling too. I live in an extremely small village

46
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,100
where things are quiet. Yeah, I was living in extremely small village. Yeah,

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,060
I live in an extremely small village where things are quiet and I mean

48
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,300
literally quiet. There's barely any sound

49
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,820
loudest thing I hear daily is the tweeting of birds, the gentle breeze and

50
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,980
the distant shotguns of people killing themselves in the background.

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:49,020
I find these funny, but my sense of humor is kind of retarded. So again,

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,260
feedback, please.

53
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,380
So I want feedback on my jokes. I'm fifteen. This is my first time doing

54
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,680
this. Okay, can you read

55
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,660
can you read that one about the village again? I live in an extremely small

56
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,200
village

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,660
where things are quiet and I mean literally quiet.

58
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,640
There's barely any sound. The loudest thing I hear daily is the tweeting of

59
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,620
birds, the gentle breeze and distant shotguns of people killing themselves in

60
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,320
sorry. I said in the background. It's in boredom in boredom in board because

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,180
it's so quiet.

62
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,140
So just real quick ratings ratings on that set. I like the when you said the

63
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,620
flesh wounds joke that was good. That was good. It's kind of a brick. This

64
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,440
six is probably British. Yeah. Oh yeah. He lives in a village. Yeah. He's

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,220
either British or Romanian. Oh

66
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,720
I thought that the jokes maybe lacked a little bit of perspective. Okay. I don't

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,460
exactly know anything more about you other than the fact that you're

68
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,200
fifteen years old. Well, I'll tell you this is my first stand up comedy bit

69
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,940
feedback would be much appreciated two different kinds of shit. I'm sixteen

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,700
now and I have wanted to be a comedian for ages. This is just my first attempt

71
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
at a bit and I'm going to take them. I'm going to get real comfortable on this

72
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,420
one. Yeah, Mike out of the stand. This is just my first attempt at a bit judge

73
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,300
harshly do what you have to do. I want to improve okay. So here's my new my

74
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,740
new bit now that I'm a year older, a year, wise years past. This is my new

75
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:15,960
bit.

76
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,840
I know shit and poop are the same thing,

77
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:27,400
but there is a distinct different between a shit and a poop poop is a

78
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,160
little glop yeah, a glop just a boot

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:40,380
just drops take diaper off. No mess. A shiver is a shit. A shit is the

80
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,960
fucking mess that seems to spread like a viral disease. It spreads like it's got

81
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,120
half a brain to go somewhere and has a cab to catch. It starts by the shitter

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,620
and ends up in your kid's hair, probably in his mouth. If you're a shit parent,

83
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,000
always in their mouths, kids won't take food made for eating, but give them some

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,740
shit and ten seconds flat, it'll be in their mouth. If not in their mouths, then

85
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:08,220
in your mouth. So that's my shit versus. I think that that shit versus poop that

86
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,780
it's going somewhere very good yeah yeah. It's on its way versus poop yeah is

87
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,700
really good. Are you getting there versus I think a year has definitely made you

88
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,660
yeah smarter, stronger, what happens when you're seventeen? Well, let's see

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,780
because now I'm seventeen okay, okay,

90
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,460
and I just did my first open mic

91
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,420
and I totally bomb.

92
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,220
I don't have a video, but here are some of my jokes. Tell me what you think

93
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,100
and feel free to steal them. Number one, I was with a friend at a party the

94
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,620
the other day and notice someone dropped something into her drink. I rushed over

95
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,140
and tried to stop her from drinking it, but I was too late and she passed out.

96
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,100
Now, like the good friend, I am. I sat next to her the entire night and made

97
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,500
sure no one touched her while I had sex with her

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,360
Jesus

99
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,500
at the bar or the party. I think I was at a part yet in the middle of party.

100
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,660
Yeah, okay, just you know yeah

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,980
yeah, it's all number to joke, but rape isn't funny. That's why we have rape

102
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,520
whistles

103
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,140
because it's not funny,

104
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,660
an incredible invention that has saved millions of girls from getting raped

105
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,420
each year. Extremely effective. That's why I like to take my dates to sporting

106
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:20,820
events.

107
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,380
Oh, you're a rapist, you're you rape. It's kind of guys. I'm kind of doing

108
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,340
Anthony Jessel Nick thing. I have the suit on. It's kind of dark humor. Okay,

109
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,300
I'm only really preferences old like warning yeah or anything. Well, I did

110
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,220
kind of say that I had a kind of a our worded sense of humor. That's true

111
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,240
number three. I hate living with roommates because we get into fights all

112
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,600
the time over the littlest things like the other day. My roommate caught me

113
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,880
eating his food and got mad at me. So in retaliation, he broke one of my DVDs. I

114
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,340
was mad at first until I realized the joke was on him. It was his sister's DVD.

115
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,560
yeah. She let me borrow it after I fucked

116
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,860
okay

117
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,760
number four. Okay, so this is two. This is a two part question. Oh, okay, male

118
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,360
athletes are scumbags. They have sex with hundreds of women and have dozens of

119
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,440
kids that they never take care of. You never hear about that with women

120
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,260
athletes. I think that's because women, unlike men, actually have responsibility

121
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,960
and take care of their kids by having an abortion.

122
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,240
I think the face there is really good. The face is pulling a little. I do all

123
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,000
that yeah say that say that joke again, but like mug the whole time mug the

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,640
whole time and then once you hit the punch line, I want you to basically just

125
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,320
like look into the look right into the camera. Okay,

126
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:51,000
male athletes are scumbags. They have sex with hundreds of women and have

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,180
dozens of kids that they never take care of. You never hear about that with

128
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,280
women athletes. I think that's because women, unlike men, actually have

129
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,120
responsibility and take care of their kids by having an abortion.

130
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:09,360
That's amazing that better yeah, that's really it's hard for women athletes to

131
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,920
have an abortion, though, because they're always in the public eye and millions of

132
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,040
girls look up to them as role models. Plus, they practice running up and down

133
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,200
stairs every day. Just try pushing them down one flight of them damn nearly

134
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,880
impossible.

135
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,080
so you hit the woo button on that. Wait, say that again. Guys, I have always

136
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,600
thought titles were weird. I feel like you have to be proficient in something

137
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,640
to call yourself it. Like I've played music most of my life, so I would call

138
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,400
myself a musician. I'm a student, a programmer, a registered sex offender

139
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,120
required to by law to tell you I'm moving into your neighbourhood.

140
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,160
So I made two edits to my post. Number one was grammar and number two was

141
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,120
thanks everyone for the feedback. I like offensive jokes just because I want

142
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,440
people to realize how stupid it is to get offended at certain things. It's

143
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,040
just jokes, but I realize I'm not as good as a writer as Jessel Nick or car.

144
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,400
That's Jimmy car yeah, so it may just come off as crude to be crude. I guess

145
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,520
I'll try to stick to this safe stuff for now.

146
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:15,040
I have an example of safe stuff. Safe stuff would be probably a not you do a

147
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,160
safe joke right now.

148
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,080
Yeah, sure

149
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:26,080
I think Hannibal Lecter got humans and Lay's potato chips mixed up.

150
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Okay, that'll be, I'll be back later.

151
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,080
Give it up, everybody. Who's next? I can go next.

152
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,080
Our next comedian is going to be, he's very, very funny. Please give it up for Cameron Fetter, ladies and gentlemen.

153
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:56,880
Keep it going for Cameron. Wow, look at him. How's it going? Everybody good man.

154
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,920
Crazy show so far, huh? Zoom the camera.

155
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,280
Let's see here. So I got to remember what I'm doing. You know, as a stand up

156
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,680
or sometimes you'd get all your jokes mixed up. Sure, everybody knows now it

157
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,120
doesn't happen to me really. My wife

158
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,080
is a big fan of grape jam.

159
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm not a fan myself, but it's better than banana jam didn't sit right for a

160
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,480
week after that horror.

161
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,900
What is banana jam? The other day, my Spotify started playing music in my

162
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,360
pocket. It was MC Hammers, You Can't Touch This. That song is so good, I

163
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,600
couldn't help but dance to it. I even got passerbys involved in everything.

164
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,320
It was great.

165
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,680
The people at my grandma's funeral were not happy.

166
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,520
You were dancing at your grandmother's fucking funeral? To Spotify from my

167
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,960
pocket. To Spotify from the pocket, yeah. Pocket Spotify at my grandma's funeral.

168
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,440
but you said you got people to dance with you, so it seems like they were

169
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,720
oh okay at the people were walking by the funeral yeah. There was an outside

170
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,480
funeral. Okay, the hardest part about the gym is hunger yeah. It very hard to

171
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,560
lose weight when you eat all the time pulls out a snickers

172
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,800
Guys, I have a 35-year-old friend who argues that he's not a millennial.

173
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,640
I read in a blog that said, "I'm a Xennial."

174
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,160
It's the term for someone born in the late '80s who doesn't identify as a millennial.

175
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,000
Which is the most millennial sentence ever spoken?

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,600
Anybody?

177
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,160
Vince Young retired from football today.

178
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,160
In other news, as of yesterday, Vince Young was still considered a football player.

179
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,000
Damn.

180
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,500
who

181
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:07,040
Christianity explains a lot. It explains why I get sexually aroused by barbecue

182
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,520
three

183
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:19,840
read Genesis women evolved from ribs. That's where they get those thick meaty

184
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,060
curves.

185
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,680
barbecue sauce makes an amazing lube in the bedroom to my GF never lets me use

186
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,320
it like that, but occasionally she will get me off with a dry rub.

187
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,200
That's pretty good, but we can't use BBQ sauce. No, it hurt. I saw you on salt

188
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
all over your cock and cayenne pepper. Democrats are now considering allowing

189
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,520
prayer back in schools after discovering recently that prayers work.

190
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,200
recently prayers were discovered that they work by Democrats

191
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,320
a couple months back. I discovered a secret setting on our shower head and

192
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,440
promptly used it to clean my nether region, causing me to accidentally shit

193
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,020
the tub.

194
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:10,600
Since then, I've been accidentally shitting the tub every day.

195
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,300
I have a question on that yeah. What so you you washed your my third reason

196
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,780
balls. I think it means, but

197
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,160
another reason is your penis and your balls. Well, I guess it's including the

198
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,760
but because how did it make him shit the toe? That's what I'm that's my

199
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,160
question, but also why would washing your ass make you shit? Well, that's the

200
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,360
maybe it was so clogged that he got the he was like pulling up like a cork out

201
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,800
yeah cork of shit. Oh, well, I don't forget it's a secret setting yeah as

202
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:49,000
also you don't know. He was do it was like douching his as it must have been

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,740
with the shower head and then it

204
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,580
made him a minute unplugged. All the sorry, where I get healthy. I make my

205
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
own mayonnaise

206
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:07,820
gotta beat the hell out of eggs and oil. It's not hard, though. See it uses the

207
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,420
same muscles as masturbating no, which is what you do when girls find out you

208
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:19,160
I can't afford mayonnaise. It's a viscous cycle. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

209
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,460
a viscous cycle. That's pretty good man. I recently ripped my pants for the

210
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,200
fifth time this year. I am to pants as Hulk Hogan is to t shirts.

211
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,880
I rip pants off my body.

212
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,240
When I liked and became a fan of all those stupid spam pages two years ago, I

213
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,040
had no idea my news feed would become a breeding ground for misused memes,

214
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,820
screenshots from Tumblr, poorly photoshopped pictures of Obama, and misquoted sayings over

215
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,220
a picture of space.

216
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,580
Sad news.

217
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,860
The British simile champion has died.

218
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,780
We shall not see his like again.

219
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,940
You shall not see his like again.

220
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,620
Okay, here's some that I need feedback on.

221
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Okay.

222
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
All right.

223
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Tell me what you think of these jokes.

224
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
Please be honest.

225
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,620
I'm going to keep this short and sweet.

226
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,080
Please be honest.

227
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,000
The second season of Stranger Things was released on Netflix last week.

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The show's entire young cast is back for another season.

229
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,260
They've all aged horribly.

230
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:24,520
This cast has aged so poorly that even Kevin Spacey doesn't believe any of them are 14 years old.

231
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,520
[laughter]

232
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,760
Netflix cancelled House of Cards amid the allegations made against Kevin Spacey.

233
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,520
Kevin's accuser has alleged that he's seen people laugh at Spacey's Johnny Carson impression

234
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,960
and he knows others that have managed to stay awake through an entire episode of

235
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,680
house of cards.

236
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,260
Damn, that's like a late night joke. Oh wait. You want feedback on these

237
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,780
individuals on this? I would say the worst part about these two is that it

238
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,980
feels like they're pretty old. Yeah, yeah, maybe this will this this might

239
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,880
address. What do you mean? Okay,

240
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,040
like I think we're there about a five or no, I have one for this hold on about

241
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,520
age. Yeah, Kevin Spacey and

242
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,680
celebrated her seven twenty second year old birthday. It was a small affair of

243
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,080
forty nine people and Caitlyn Jenner.

244
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:16,000
Kendall's sisters, Chloe and Kylie, were unable to attend the party due to both

245
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,440
being pregnant. Despite of this, the sisters, baby daddies, OJ Simpson and

246
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,120
Lucifer, attended the affair. Oh damn, both were pictured together drinking

247
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,080
margaritas and casually laughing while reminiscing about a deal. The two struck

248
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,440
together twenty two years ago. See that one's also about age. See okay, this one's

249
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,120
thought about it. That's okay. That's my it's not you're misunderstanding my

250
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,160
problem. I don't care about if the joke has age in it. The iPhone ten is I

251
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,040
don't that's not

252
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,280
next month. The eighth star wars will be released.

253
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,100
The results twice in eight weeks, people from around the world will wait on

254
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,160
massive lines to consume the newest version of the exact same product that

255
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,400
they've owned for years.

256
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,280
That one I like yeah yeah people not about age yeah, I like that one yeah

257
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay, that's the end of the feedback part.

258
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Okay.

259
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,960
Blue No Matter Who is a good slogan for Democratic voters, but it's a terrible slogan for lifeguards.

260
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
That one's pretty good.

261
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
That's kind of fun.

262
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,440
That one's actually pretty good.

263
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,920
Sorry, you said feedback's over.

264
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,600
Yeah, there's no feedback on that one.

265
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,480
Am I the only one that finds it frustrating that every time you go home and try to sit

266
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,520
down and watch the news Huey Lewis is singing over them?

267
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,360
I actually kind of like that one.

268
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
That one's good too.

269
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,460
I was a little funny. Okay, okay, I think we should ban abortion and then raise

270
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,800
those babies as our military. Send them over twenty years later, the mother gets

271
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,180
a telegram, I guess a telegram

272
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:49,580
in twenty years. I go back to telegrams.

273
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:56,100
The mother gets a telegram. Remember that abortion you wanted done. Damn

274
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,540
okay, that's fire yeah.

275
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:05,020
I want to open a store like Build-A-Bear, but with shirts. I'll call it Get Your

276
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,840
Shirt Together. Okay, well, real quickly, can you walk me through what that would

277
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,060
look like? Yeah, so you'd pick a shirt, but like Build-A-Bear, you put the- Are

278
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,740
you going to put the sleeves on the shirt? Are you- Yeah, so and then you- It's

279
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,340
not just you don't just put something on the front of the shirt. There you have

280
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,460
it. You pick the color of the shirt. Yeah, and you can decide whether or not it

281
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,340
has sleeves. You can go tank top or- I think you just- Sleeveless shirt. You

282
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,820
but it'll be called get your shirt together. Yeah, because I mean the name

283
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,000
to do one long, a place about name one short sleeve or buttons. You can pick

284
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,400
buttons if it's button down yeah, okay, anyway, I want to go as a vice

285
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,940
journalist for Halloween. Does anyone have a trust fund I can borrow

286
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:49,320
I just went bankrupt to heater heater from from Cameron? I'm so fat and my

287
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,360
boobs are so big.

288
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,980
If I were a t shirt with writing, people actually have to move their heads to

289
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,300
reread it. Holy Shit Damn, I always check IMDB before saying

290
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:06,100
I always check IMDB before saying Disney and Nickelodeon actresses are hot just

291
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,820
to make sure I am not a pervert.

292
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:16,520
This guy's a lot of Disney and Nickelodeon

294
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,560

295
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,680
you know, just as Disney, the kind of the yes, it is a company office. I

296
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,160
guess, oh, that's fine. What does depression feel like put on a denim

297
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,320

I saw this little kid wearing a t shirt that said Pugs, not drugs. When are

00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,900
Oh, you fell for my joke.

308
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,020
Tricked you.

309
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,780
Saw a fat guy in a Captain America shirt

310
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,940
breathing with his mouth open.

311
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,240
He may not be Captain America, but he is America.

312
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,420
- Wow.

313
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,820
- If men are turned on by wet t-shirt contests,

314
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:38,460
then why aren't women attracted to men who pee their pants?

315
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,700
Tired of double standards.

316
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,540
- Thank you.

317
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,780
- If you're going to wear a wife beater t-shirt,

318
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,880
you should at least look like you could beat up your wife.

319
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,720
Look at this.

320
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,380
- That is a good one.

321
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,140
Wow, all right, you're lighting me. Okay, I'm going to go ten minutes.

322
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:57,860
Sorry, so it's cool to talk about your vintage car, bust out your old record

323
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,460
player, but the moment I mentioned my chamber pot dot dot dot that one's

324
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,600
pretty funny. Okay, we're going to go through these quickly living in

325
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,340
Williamsburg. I can never tell if someone riding a horse is part of the

326
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,780
colonial ambiance or someone saving gas money.

327
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,220
I trombone you.

328
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,900
I gave you a trombone. My friend is in the hospital after breathing in toxic

329
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,540
fibers from the ceiling of his house. The doctors are doing asbestos. They can

330
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:26,780
would you make that joke like in the hospital? I don't think so. Well, I'm

331
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,020
not in a hospital. Would you make that? I think a doctor would like to this kind

332
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,200
of my friend got fired from her last job in retaliation for being a whistle

333
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,180
blower. She was discovered by the CEO's wife, Mrs. Whistle.

334
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,580
He's blowing

335
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,740
his wife.

336
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,880
he's blowing his wife. I spent most of my 20s in a cult like a full-blown shave

337
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,240
your head and leave your family to live on a compound kind of cult. It got pretty

338
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,340
wild. They put stuff in our food to stop us from getting horny and they made us

339
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,540
all dress the same and sing songs about our leader every morning. You've

340
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,240
probably seen them in your town trying to get more people to join. Yeah, you

341
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,140
might remember them. You might remember seeing them on the news when our leader

342
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,840
told us to kill Osama bin Laden.

343
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,340
So think about that one for a second. Yeah, that's think about it.

344
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,300
political. I'm going to do I okay, I'm just going to skip to the last one here.

345
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:24,200
I believe that Amber Heard's career is over, though. I've heard rumors,

346
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,700
though. I've heard rumors that Amber might do Aquaman porn spoof for the rest

347
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,080
of her life, but she'll never get to fuck Aquaman. Instead, Amber Heard fucks

348
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,900
the giant octopus monster and an octopus has eight tentacles. She gets three

349
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,640
tentacles fucking her mouth, three tentacles, fucking her pussy and two

350
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,640
tentacles holding a phone live streaming all this and when the octopus finally

351
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:50,960
climaxes, it busts its nasty sticky gooey ink all over her face. I think that

352
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,080
would be the only time that people could actually believe that Amber heard

353
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:02,020
received a black eye. Holy shit and that and that's what you didn't want. You

354
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,520
didn't want feedback on that one. No, that one's fully formed. Okay, I know. I

355
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,300
think that was perfect. All right, next up to the stage. Thank you for your time,

356
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,140
everybody. Next up we got Patrick Doran.

357
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
Yes.

358
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:18,740
Okay, we're losing some audience members.

359
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,340
Yeah, you got a little hot here with that Amber Heard joke, huh? Couldn't handle that.

360
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:32,780
Bye bye, you triggered asshats. Bye bye, SJWs.

361
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,900
I have some actual I've actually some

362
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,580
some poems that I'd like to read. Okay, fuck you.

363
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,960
No, it's okay. They're comedic in nature. It's called an open mic. Okay,

364
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,440
well I'm gonna... Hold on, I gotta hang that back up. This one is called

365
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,980
Dude Bro. Okay. And it's a haiku.

366
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,780
The dude is a bro. Can you count them out while you do it,

367
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,720
like a haiku? Count out the syllable? The dude is a bro.

368
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,620
Bro like dude, broski brother.

369
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:10,260
here. Dude bro like yeah man. I like that you counted five for each of them. This

370
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:16,600
one is called No Milk. Okay. Man buys cow, no milk. Whore in street demands

371
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,900
money. Masturbates to porn. Wait, say it again slowly. Man buys cow, no milk.

372
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:31,260
Okay. Whore in street demands money. Masturbates to porn. Oh, I think I get

373
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:38,660
it. These are some some haikus another haiku. Okay,

374
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:42,900
it's called no simping. Okay,

375
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,440
X miss is here soon. She is looking for that simp clause, no simping on X miss

376
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:58,020
simp clause like Santa. Yeah, like Santa, which hold on. Let me get the companion

377
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,620
poem here.

378
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Simpa Claus.

379
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Wait, Simpa Claus?

380
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
Wait, who is this?

381
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,720
Once upon a time lived a man who would simp for any women in sight.

382
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,800
Still stuck in the fairy tale life, he became the White Knight.

383
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,100
Listening to his women, he did everything she asked.

384
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,840
Buying the kids Christmas presents, he became a money-making slave.

385
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:26,220
She would always tease him with sex and telling him to earn more money and learn to behave.

386
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,660
One day they got in a big fight, arguing over money and bills.

387
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,700
While he was at work, she was looking for a cheap thrill.

388
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,860
She cheated on him with the neighbor.

389
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,240
She was giving him head.

390
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,740
They went in the back of the house to fuck in the woodshed.

391
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,620
On Christmas day, he was heartbroken and she begged him for another chance.

392
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,340
The simp went for it and he started to do a funny dance.

393
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:55,240
Then one day she left him for another man when he was at rock bottom and broke.

394
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:01,360
She told him, "I just used you for Christmas. You're a low-life loser. You're a fucking joke."

395
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,080
Now all alone after losing his job, becoming too heartbroken to perform his work, he started

396
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,660
to watch men going their own way videos on YouTube. Then he changed into a red pill jerk.

397
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
The end.

398
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
Wow.

399
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Who is the writer of the author?

400
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,040
These are all by Joe Fettig.

401
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
We've seen him before.

402
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,040
We've seen him before.

403
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
We've worked with him.

404
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,000
We've worked with him. I'm looking again at his work.

405
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
He's really amazing.

406
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,160
It's really amazing. You know how amazing he is? Let me read you this one.

407
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,680
I am going to fart in a jar and save it for later. Do you want to take a sniff?

408
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,200
I know you like smelling your own farts, so take a whiff.

409
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,720
Guys like to fart and girls weep.

410
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm going to squeeze out a nasty fart. What a relief.

411
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,120
The stench fills the air. Oh my God. What is that smell?

412
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,420
rotten beef. No fart in a jar and save gas because the smell is starting to

413
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,700
linger. My last fart didn't make it in the jar, so smell my finger. Oh

414
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,820
open up that lady far. I got a smell. You couldn't make it to the maybe he

415
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,000
was opening the jar and he for his finger. Well, I was trying to get it

416
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,020
hard already. Yeah, I got on his finger. The fart got on his on his finger on

417
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,760
his finger. Okay, when he was trying to open the door, I got a smelly

418
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,740
surprise. The smell is so strong. It'll get you high. I'd smoke that. I got my

419
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,160
fart jar on me. Want to smell my toxic gas? It fills the air. Whoever smelt it

420
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,200
dealt it. Gotta be toxic warfare. What? Fart in a jar and share it with your

421
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,880
friends. I just ate some broccoli and cheese. It's time to colon cleans.

422
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,740
Okay.

423
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,600
'Cause it rhymes. Yeah.

424
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,000
Let me read this next one here. I got a bunch more, but how much time do I have?

425
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,560
You're I mean, you should wrap up pretty soon. Wrap up. OK. Yeah.

426
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,400
Fuck child support.

427
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,000
These modern women are using the court system to take advantage of men

428
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,160
and extorting their money.

429
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,480
The government needs to start tracking single mother spending habits.

430
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,520
That would be really funny.

431
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,000
Spending that child support money on nails and weaves,

432
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,160
hustling two to three baby daddies one at a time.

433
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,160
Holy. What a bunch of thieves.

434
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,600
Damn. She's trying to have her cake and eat it too.

435
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,680
She is done chasing the bad boys.

436
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
Now she wants a nice guy.

437
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,400
And that is you.

438
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,760
Me? You.

439
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,120
Me? Fuck child support.

440
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,720
Men are going their own way.

441
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,360
Now we can watch these angry feminists cry.

442
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,920
Society keeps saying they don't need men anymore

443
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,520
as they walk away from work and turn a blind eye.

444
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,840
More men are walking away from love and relationships,

445
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,400
taking the red pill, the downfall of society.

446
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,440
We are not going to be your slave or servant anymore living all alone, a

447
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,200
relief of anxiety. Fuck child support. I don't need no narcissistic bitch in my

448
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,120
life. You're not entitled to my love or my money. Fuck you, bitch. You'll never

449
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,000
be my wife. Fuck child support. I'm not gonna pay you, bitch. You still stunting

450
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,920
at the club.

451
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,800
Damn.

452
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
At the club.

453
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,720
Females having dual mating strategies and still they end up with a scrub.

454
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,620
Wow, those are some poems by Mr.

455
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:24,960
We got he has a new book coming out. What's it called called men guarding

456
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,280
their own wallets? Oh, wow, that is a book of poetry on Amazon. I will be

457
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,480
yeah.

458
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,100
Okay, I'll be down on that might be a ZW three. If it's on yeah, would you

459
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,840
mind introducing me? Because I yeah, I'm aging for stage time. I

460
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,600
you know, I want to welcome this next comedian to the stage. He's very,

461
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,400
very funny, but ladies and gentlemen, give it up for Caleb Bitts.

462
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:56,860
Yeah. Go Caleb. Go Caleb.

463
00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:03,640
Wait, can you keep doing that dance? Huh? Can you keep doing that dance?

464
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:12,360
No. Uh oh, you're gonna have a bad set, Caleb. Pat's looking at the sound board.

465
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,160
Yeah, he's definitely gonna... Just leave it. It's fine. It's alright.

466
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:22,280
Guys, I have been writing jokes for about a year now, and I think it's time I finally attempt

467
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:28,140
to put it to use on stage. However, I have two main problems. One, I am only 17, not

468
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:33,800
sure if underage is okay. Two, I do not know which route to take. Short one-liners, dirty/crude

469
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,840
humor, long story-esque jokes. Below are some of the many jokes I have written, and I was

470
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,780
wondering what you guys thought of them. If they would fare well to audiences, any famous

471
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:47,040
these comedians I might possibly remind you of etcetera. Honestly would be the

472
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,640
most important. I would rather be shit on here than boot of stage IRL. Thanks

473
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,760
you said Joe Rogan yeah

474
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,920
here's some examples of some of my jokes. I majored in ornithology for the

475
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,920
chicks. Oh, you don't get that that joke. You should probably brush up on your

476
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,520
zoology knowledge. Wait that means you're a pedophile

477
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,520
does that I think

478
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,600
the drive right nope no no no no no no no

479
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,300
I'm only seventeen. The drive through at McDonald's must be a lot more expensive.

480
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,160
If you take the concept literally,

481
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,200
if you crash your car

482
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,440
into the front of a McDonald's and you just kill people and you break

483
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,320
everything, yeah, it will be more than a hamburger.

484
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:43,200
cost a pretty penny. I question God for one reason. He made potato chips the

485
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,760
best food to eat while watching TV and movies, yet made it impossible to eat

486
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,960
them quietly. Oh, I've tried, let me tell you. Sir, can you go off your phone?

487
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,720
Sorry. What are you doing?

488
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,000
Something really bad just happened. Something really bad? Yeah. Okay.

489
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,280
Oh, I've tried, let me tell you. I have tried. It's ridiculous. Most foods eat

490
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,080
slower equals less noise. Nope, not for chips. Same noise level and you just

491
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,600
look like a moron eating them one at a time and acting all sneaky about it.

492
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,840
Okay, I'll admit this next one is fucked up, but hopefully funny nonetheless.

493
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,320
Okay.

494
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:23,960
My girlfriend cheated on me and to get back at her, I hooked up with her

495
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,480
younger sister. You would not believe how easy it is to get a 13 year old to

496
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,480
put out these days. Not really though, I'm just not suave enough to do that.

497
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,640
I have no clue how any guy can do that successfully. Instead, I did the next

498
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,040
best thing, found her sister on Facebook and jerked off to pictures of her.

499
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
(Applause)

500
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,200
Yep, that's where I'm at right now. Room of complete strangers who now

501
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
undoubtedly think I am creepy as shit.

502
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,940
What are you playing?

503
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,440
I'm playing the applause, but I didn't know that the applause was long.

504
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,840
Okay, I need more feedback on some jokes. Here are some jokes I wrote.

505
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,940
Please let me know what you think of them. They might be considered a little

506
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:02,960
unusual.

507
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:11,780
If rain is God crying, then please explain to me why there hasn't been at

508
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,140
least one major cum storm

509
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,960
snow, snow.

510
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,580
If you could go into you could go into snow. I unfortunately lost my mom a

511
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,160
year ago

512
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,060
and I haven't been able to find that bitch since

513
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,880
yeah, that one's good. That's a one that email Phillips yeah, where my mom at

514
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,200
where my mom at yeah say that again and then add where my mom at okay. I

515
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,620
unfortunately lost my mom a year ago and I haven't been able to find that bitch

516
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,080
since

517
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:50,140
there are a bunch of new gender words that you're expected to know the meaning

518
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:56,720
of like gender fluid, gender fluid, not to confuse with gender fluid because God

519
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,260
damn don't drink that shit.

520
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,720
Oh, that one's good. That is pretty good. The where's Waldo books are a lot less

521
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,220
fun when you learn that the reason you're looking for Waldo is because he's

522
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,760
why he's wanted he's basically wanted to breathe was going to blow up a mosque.

523
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,980
Is that true?

524
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,380
That's why you're looking for Waldo.

525
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,160
I never knew that it's right here. I don't know what to tell you. That's

526
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,400
crazy yeah okay, don't get into one of those clown cars guys. I know you've

527
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,460
been everybody's been walking around saying I want to get in a one car, but

528
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,320
don't get into them. Don't get guys. Don't conquer do not get into car. Do

529
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,560
not

530
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,560
want to know why okay, because the clowns have sex in the cars.

531
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:52,080
Okay, I'm getting ready for my first stand up gig and I'm looking for

532
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,520
feedback on my writing and potential bits okay. All right, no wait. Do I want

533
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,340
to do this one or

534
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,140
yeah, I'll do this one all right.

535
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:05,620
Thanks everyone for coming out to the opening. Oh yeah, okay, all right.

536
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,900
There's an ex post from our stand up. So here's the opening part of my set.

537
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,800
Thanks everyone for coming out to the opening show of my nobody knows who the

538
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,780
fuck I am tour.

539
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,580
It starts tonight here on this stage and it also ends tonight about four minutes

540
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:24,160
for now in the men's bathroom with me crying hysterically of embarrassment.

541
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,040
No, that second show is standing room only by the way, so tickets are going

542
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:29,560
fast

543
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,920
wife at home. This is my wife at home's part of my jokes. Can I give feedback

544
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,360
really quick on that? Yeah, maybe you could say instead of singing room only,

545
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,000
maybe say there are two seats, yeah, and then it's going to be saying you're

546
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,240
only like maybe there's a toilets in the bathroom. There's two must be a dirty

547
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,760
shit and piss. There's two seats. Well, it's just does it's not standing

548
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,960
remotely. It's just the only room that has a prime. I don't want to talk

549
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,120
about toilets. There's two, there's two urinals and two urinals. I actually

550
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,720
don't have any aspirations of becoming a stand up comedian. However, I do

551
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,960
have three daughters under the age of six. So this is pretty much

552
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,840
the most stress free situation I could find on a Tuesday night. You have no

553
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,600
idea what my wife is going through right now, but it involves all of the

554
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,480
major bodily fluids, except the fun one that got us into this parenting mess in

555
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,180
the first place. So I'm up here and basically my wife's at home with my

556
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:28,620
three daughters and they're covered in piss and fucking spit and shit, but no

557
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,400
jizz at all and vomit. Is it because you're not there? If I was there to be

558
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,900
there, it is all over them. Yeah, I'd be jizz. You'd be that jizzing yeah.

559
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,260
should I attack that with that do it again do it again. Yeah, that's a no

560
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,580
idea what my wife is going through right now, but it involves all of the major

561
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,160
bodily fluids, except the fun one that got us into this parenting mess in the

562
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,660
first place. But if I was there, my wife and daughters, I'd be jizzing all over

563
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:54,920
the

564
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,700
better

565
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,600
trains is my train joke. All right, everyone's got one last weekend. We took

566
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:07,180
the kids to a miniature train ride in the park. They had set up these little

567
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,420
steam engines for the kids to sit on and ride around on little tracks. The best

568
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,180
is that a real conductor has to drive the train around at 4 miles per hour and they take their

569
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,340
jobs very seriously. As we were waiting in line, I overheard one of the conductors say

570
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,940
to the other, "These kids today, they don't know nothing about trains. It's a goddamn

571
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,420
disgrace." I thought to myself, "He's right." And maybe kids don't know nothing about trains

572
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:31,100
nowadays because trains are a 170-year-old technology. I hear there have been several

573
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:36,020
exciting inventions since Frontier America, some of them even involving electricity. And

574
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,560
and by the way, Mr surly train conductor, my kids will probably be zipping around

575
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
on a fucking jet pack in virtual reality multiverse. So the excitement of steam

576
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,060
locomotion might be lost on them.

577
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,020
Can I ask a question? Are you still seventeen?

578
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,020
I don't think he's seventeen. Yeah, I'm eighteen years old.

579
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,520
This is my bit about lying Chris

580
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,960
wait right already. I saw a my I saw a my good friend Chris from college the other

581
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,760
day for the first time in forever. Remember in college when there would be

582
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,400
so many people in your group of friends with the same name that you'd have to

583
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,200
assign them stereotypical adjectives. So everyone knew who you were talking about

584
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,560
we had like seven Chris's in our group of friends drunk Chris tall Chris dirty

585
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,840
Chris Pudwacker Chris. He was the one who got caught masturbating in the bushes

586
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,520
outside Katie Murphy's apartment.

587
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,320
Like I said, I saw lying Chris the other day for the first time since graduation

588
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,780
lucky guy. Apparently, he's won the lottery twice and now works as a

589
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,480
professional orgy coordinator in Hollywood. I'm so jealous.

590
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,380
You knew that many Chris's

591
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:48,420
five or six, I mean, five of them was a liar. There's a sexual assaulter guy.

592
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,880
One of them's dirty. Yeah.

593
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,280
Okay, dirty Chris.

594
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:59,800
New inspiring comic needs feedback on a comedy bit. Hello guys, new user here.

595
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,320
Doing stand-up is my dream, but I don't know if I got what it takes. I have a bit

596
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,040
here that I've been working on. Tell me what you think. Any feedback is welcome.

597
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,160
Okay, so this is very kind of written out word for word, okay?

598
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,720
Okay.

599
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,440
So last night, my fucking house reached a fucking new level of filth. I'm talking

600
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,000
about like type of filth they would use to air on Spike TV. Like yeah, the only

601
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,520
I would laugh when I watched Spike TV was during the fucking commercials. So anyways, my home is getting pretty messy cuz

602
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:29,280
My wife is out of town and I swear I have this condition that every time she leaves me alone for a couple days

603
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,500
I just fucking turn into a new Neanderthal

604
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,700
Like I'm just walking around my crib hunched over with just some fucking cheetah print underwear or I'll be eating KFC and I'll just be

605
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:42,880
Walking in my house devouring this chicken chewing with my mouth open looking like I fucking hunted this shit myself

606
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,940
I was dropping the fucking bones all over my nice Fendi rug

607
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,360
but that worst part is that I almost never wipe my ass when I'm in this

608
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:55,640
State of mind so yeah, I should probably get that checked out before it escalates to something

609
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:58,520
But yeah the house one of the first things to go missing when your house

610
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,480
Just looks like a straight mucky black oil spill on the Pacific Ocean

611
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,720
You know what I'm talking about when your home resembles the conditions of a third world country

612
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,640
Conditions one of the first things to go missing are either the spoons or the forks

613
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:16,980
Yep, these things escape like they believe they are the protagonist of a fucking James Bond movie

614
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,660
Someone call that James Bond or something right before he escapes from the bad guy

615
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,360
I swear

616
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:28,920
I've seen almost all the James Bond movies and this guy always does the simplest thing to escape when like not even Jesus Christ could fucking

617
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,480
Get off the cross more effortlessly than James Bond after he's been captured and let's be honest

618
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,440
What's more impressive escaping from technology made from 21st century special agents with cutting-edge technology or a fucking piece of wood?

619
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,320
wood and some rope with nails designed by people who thought the world was flat

620
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,360
and still shitted on the side of a road. Yeah, no brainer.

621
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,880
So I opened my utensil drawer looking for a spoon and I'm grabbing every fucking

622
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,720
utensil and it's anything but a spoon. God damn,

623
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,400
I was acting like a dumb ass fucking double checking, triple checking,

624
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,720
quadruple checking the same fucking spots in my cabinet.

625
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:03,040
Just hoping this shit magically appears like fucking Chris Angel in the mid

626
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,960
2000s. You guys remember Chris Angel?

627
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,320
And then I look at my sink and the sink legit looked like it threw up spoons.

628
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,680
like it was only just a shit ton of spoons, nothing else, not even a single

629
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,600
bowl. Yes, stores don't normally sell utensils individually. They almost always

630
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,680
sell some ridiculous high number. Like at night, I was at a store and I was just

631
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,880
looking at how many spoons were in the box, and I swear it seemed that they

632
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,360
just got one of those 20-year-old high school seniors and had him just pick how

633
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,240
many spoons should go in each box.

634
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,240
So that was my bit about my wife being in a town.

635
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,160
Wow, spoons and Neanderthals. And then I just have two more things, guys,

636
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,040
and I'll leave you with this. I started a Twitter account for I've been doing it

637
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,360
for six or seven years now, where I'm trying out basically my

638
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:53,520
stand up bits before I do them on stage. It's called @UpSandbox, it's the

639
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,400
stand up sandbox is what it is. I'm kind of in there playing around with my

640
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,480
joke. So just a couple of these.

641
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,680
I hear Starbucks... Sorry, I said Starbucks. You're thinking about sandboxes.

642
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,440
I hear Starbucks is in some hot water, just like their beans

643
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:17,500
and then this next one. This is my last one, San Francisco more like sans me

644
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,680
parenthesis. I do not live there.

645
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,120
Thank you guys. Thank you. Wow, your next comedian coming to the stage

646
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:31,280
is some poems. Huh, I'm gonna do poems next poet going to the stage, say poet.

647
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,040
Oh sorry, the next poet coming to the stage

648
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,960
marriage, the one and only Cameron Fetter

649
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:53,720
wow look at him look at him take the jacket off. I feel like you're entering

650
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:59,600
another level. Yeah, I did that just now. Holy shit, okay, hold on. Let me get my

651
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:06,920
I'm just going to do a few poems on a theme that's pretty near and dear to me.

652
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:14,080
This first poem is entitled "A Day of Reckoning" and I just want everybody to know in the audience

653
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,640
that we've been doing a lot of laughing and it's okay if you want to cry instead.

654
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,480
Yeah, all of my poems were supposed to make you cry or think.

655
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,480
So cry with laughter is fine or cry with sadness or fear.

656
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,800
Either one's fine.

657
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,600
but just don't be afraid to cry out of being afraid. Okay, a day of reckoning.

658
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,800
It was a day of reckoning.

659
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,800
No, or so it was said

660
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:46,800
it came from around me and into my head down from their website comes sounded

661
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,900
voice. It intrudes my surroundings. No rights of a choice. It's called voice to

662
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:59,100
skull simply put V2K hours of torture debilitates me that way. I lay in my bed

663
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,600
all tense and I shake. I don't know how much more of this I can take. The game

664
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,600
that is played on a computer screen, my body is scanned on the website it's

665
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,800
seen. They see what I see, they know every thought hidden in a cyber space,

666
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,100
not a force to be caught. A microchip in my back. No. Is there one in my head?

667
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:25,740
The ways it connects to replay what was said, my mind in the battle, the frequency that they

668
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,860
use, a game meant to destroy, torture, and abuse.

669
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,860
That's a day of reckoning.

670
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
Holy shit.

671
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,560
I'm going to go straight into the other two.

672
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,700
This one is called Cyber Science.

673
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,580
A microchip inserted underneath the skin while asleep on the couch, an intruder came in,

674
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,220
a website was started.

675
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:49,200
The present day, once the past, the torturous journey was going to last.

676
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,740
more intent to harm and cause to destroy the the voices that echo are meant to

677
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,380
annoy a sharp repeated tone that enters my mind words spoken clear come up from

678
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,180
behind the excuse and the lies to continue the plight. The website is

679
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,400
illegal that challenge a fight

680
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:09,700
the push of reverberation. I tense up and shake the horror that follow when I

681
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:15,500
need a break the saliva that flow as the magic in me never knowing just how the

682
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:20,040
the saliva that flow as the magic in me, never knowing just how my cough comes to

683
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:23,840
be into the unknown, hidden from sight in search of an answer when wrong is not

684
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,200
right. If only the secret I could come to know how does the fluid in my sinuses

685
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:28,600
flow

686
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:34,880
from a computer, the insolent grin and investigation, but where to begin pain in

687
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,960
my stomach and pain in my toes to cause me discomfort and clog up my nose. The

688
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,000
pressure is real. My foot hurts every day.

689
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:42,700
thank you

690
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:51,560
really the website that follow just hits me that way. Oh my God, Cyber Science is

691
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:55,520
stalking to put me to death a time of survival with hope in each breath and

692
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,400
here's the last one it's entitled a virtual reality attack. My body once

693
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,100
scanned into a virtual design, the images around me snipers formed in a

694
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,200
line. The walls took aim translucent each shot. One side was laughter. The

695
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:14,080
other side not. Distress as gruesome as blood curdling screams, the nightmare illusion,

696
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,800
the destroyer of dreams, the terror internal, the shock made me run, a virtual target of

697
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,040
the sharpshooter's gun. A specter led army, the dark shadow rose, hidden in the position

698
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,600
each presence imposed, to bludgeon the target as if it threw stone, unfocused from sight,

699
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:36,360
mind bruised and alone, a wound of defamation, the poison of choice, each glassy figure that

700
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,020
that shatter my voice trapped in the silence where I could not speak each

701
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,000
shot that impair made me feel weak shot. Notice that shot yeah, think about it.

702
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,260
I'm thinking and I sinister motives the assassin was sent fire and brimstone a

703
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:52,980
sting of torment. Even the arrows pinches the dart, the arrows pinches the

704
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:58,100
dart, the pain that was real brought fear to my heart. The emirates society

705
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:04,760
meets back to back no, but there is no running when VR attack wow

706
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:12,200
Wow! And that was three poems prepared for today. That's amazing. I'm sorry, this is

707
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:15,760
maybe a hard thing to follow here in terms of mood, but I'm going to bring up our next

708
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:28,200
poet. Our final poet, our final act. Our final act is Patrick Doran, everybody. Give it up!

709
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,400
Thank you, Cameron.

710
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,240
It is a hard act to follow, so I guess I'll just get right into it.

711
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,860
Replace her.

712
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,360
Sex on the first date.

713
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,380
Put out or get out of my way.

714
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,560
You can be replaced.

715
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,960
Damn.

716
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,920
Garden gnome farts aloud.

717
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,520
Air polluted, smell of shit, turd chasing midget dwarf.

718
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,520
What?

719
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,520
Wait.

720
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,000
There's a poem called Garden Gnome by Joe Fettig.

721
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:57,960
Maybe he

722
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,880
is a farting garden gnome. He's a farting garden gnome, yeah. That's kind of a

723
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,920
fun prank gift.

724
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,440
Women shame incels, not all men can be controlled. Lose weight, big fat whale.

725
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:24,320
Passport bros get hate, society doesn't understand until it's too late.

726
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,760
What's a passport bro? I think it's a man who does sex tourism.

727
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,080
Oh. Oh. Yeah. Okay. Interesting.

728
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:37,960
She wasted her youth chasing Chad ready to settle.

729
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,880
I don't like leftovers.

730
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:46,200
That was it? That's a haiku. These are haikus. Oh, okay. No,

731
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,680
they don't all seem like haikus. No. Yeah. Yeah.

732
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,480
Pay on the first date, split the bill. Equality, bitch.

733
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,000
You look like a man.

734
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,240
(laughing)

735
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,620
One red pill daily, not playing society's games.

736
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,620
My way, the highway.

737
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:11,880
Birth rates drop, marriage dead,

738
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,040
blaming men for the problems.

739
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:15,940
Agents of chaos panic.

740
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,520
The zoo hates men.

741
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,160
Get your passport, goes overseas.

742
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,500
society collapse. What is that? I have a question. What does that mean? I think

743
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:33,780
it has to do with passport bro stuff. What are passport? Okay, so you said

744
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:38,300
Chad earlier. Where do where is the what's the ranking? Basically, I think

745
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,340
Chad, there's men going their own way. There's passport bros. There's chads

746
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,180
virgins, maybe virgin versus itself, I think is a lot of what this is touching

747
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,520
coming upon yeah and you're a virgin

748
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:56,400
no, well, why are you in all your poems are about you fuck women and men going

749
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,480
my own way. It seems like more that anything you're kind of in the forest.

750
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,200
This will maybe this will

751
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,600
explain clear it up just a little bit. I'm just confused. Okay, this this will

752
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:11,000
have the mission statement in here. This is a poem called the problems in

753
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,400
western society. Okay,

754
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,360
There are many problems in Western society today.

755
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,840
Many Americans aren't ready for an economic collapse.

756
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,460
Censorship on the internet, no more freedom of speech.

757
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,440
We are all being wiretapped.

758
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,640
The homeless problem is getting worse.

759
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,560
Greedy corporations like BlackRock and Vanguard buying up homes, warfare on the people, the

760
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,960
world economic forum telling the people what we need in our lives, we refuse to take the

761
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,960
vaccine.

762
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,320
We are not sheeple.

763
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,480
Crooked politicians abusing the legal system, finding loopholes to make them rich, take them

764
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,560
them out of office. They don't care about us. Don't be there, bitch.

765
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:49,240
The nuclear family is destroyed. The feminist movement has gone too far.

766
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,440
Men are getting their passports and flying away.

767
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,080
The shaming language doesn't work anymore.

768
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:59,040
Prince Charming is not going to save you. That is the price you've got to pay.

769
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,960
Americans are so materialistic, living above their own standards,

770
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,160
just to drown in debt, a slave to the system.

771
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,760
What are we going to do when there are no internet?

772
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,880
Damn. I don't know.

773
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:13,240
Society doesn't care about men guilty until proven innocent.

774
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,880
The era of depression, society has become soft,

775
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,960
showing any signs of masculinity is known as aggression.

776
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:23,040
Suicides rates are up with gun violence

777
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,240
while the crooked politicians are laughing us

778
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,040
eating their steak.

779
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,880
They want us to buy their fake meat

780
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,080
because of climate change and our carbon footprint.

781
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,000
Fuck that!

782
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,840
Yes. Yes.

783
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,800
Fake. Yes.

784
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,000
I don't want that fake meat, man.

785
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,560
They don't care about us.

786
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,740
and watch them try to put us in another COVID lockdown, another stupid booster

787
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:45,660
shot. The people versus the government, they are trying to control us without

788
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:50,100
order. Out of chaos, we see right through the bullshit. Time to boycott.

789
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:53,220
And then this next one,

790
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,680
Oktoberfest, hops of spalt brewing, pouring the beer with great friends,

791
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,180
German style party.

792
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:04,620
Hey, you've been to Oktoberfest? There was a lot of... Would you say that

793
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,160
October Fest has a lot of Stacy's there right with

794
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:13,160
but I think a lot you ever see pictures of those German women with the giant

795
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,040
breasts at October Fest and they wear shoelaces. Where the fuck are your

796
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:17,900
nipples?

797
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,800
Their nipples have to be on the bottom of their titties, because half of them

798
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,340
are popping out of those shirts. I think a lot of it honestly is latex

799
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:30,220
prosthetics. Oh yeah. It's gotta be latex prosthetics and

800
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,480
a lot. I think it's like Halloween level costume. Yeah,

801
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,380
I don't have my testing. I don't have my password, so I can't see.

802
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,620
I think I have a few more here. No, I got a password. Here is

803
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,820
a poem

804
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,940
written by Joe Fedig.

805
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,260
Now, I want you to

806
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,940
damn there. There's a little there's some I'm gonna point it out,

807
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,460
some hypocrisy.

808
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,780
I like a policy you like honestly nowadays audiences say there's some

809
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,100
hypocrisy again yeah, there's some hypocrisy

810
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,700
wow

811
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:11,740
applause yeah well that's kind of listen to this listen to this okay. If you

812
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:16,060
love, if you love hypocrisy, you're going to love this mass layoffs happening in

813
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,620
the workplace. Will they replace man with the sheet with machine another

814
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:23,260
agenda in plain sight, no more gas powered cars. They want everyone to go

815
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,660
green getting replaced by a robot artificial intelligence is getting out

816
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:32,380
of control. The transhumanism agenda the elite want your soul. Controlling every aspect of

817
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,740
your life, living in a smart city, being charged a carbon tax, the evil leaders that you want

818
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:41,500
that you tell you that you own nothing and be happy just relax. Your robot replacement

819
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,660
will take your job and leave you on the street. Depopulate the earth, mocking the citizens

820
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,000
with a single tweet. Humans are easily replaceable. The first thing you hack is the subconscious

821
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,680
mind, divide and conquer, have race wars. It's the blind leading the blind. Corporation cutting

822
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,120
labor costs, you're replaceable at any time. CEOs being downright cheap, nobody cares, I

823
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:02,480
feel like I am a black sheep.

824
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:03,480
Whoa.

825
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,360
Nothing is guaranteed in life, not even your career. Getting replaced by a robot is something

826
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,320
that we might fear. Yeah?

827
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,280
Dude, what the fuck? I mean, I'm sorry. Can we just talk?

828
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,720
I'm sorry. Let me point out the hypocrisy here.

829
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:15,720
Okay. Yeah.

830
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:22,080
"YouTube censorship," this is posted by Joe Fetig, "YouTube censorship, a threat to free

831
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,880
speech where videos are subjected to breach by an algorithm with a heavy hand, once a

832
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,480
place for open expression, now a platform with tight discretion and voices are silenced

833
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:37,600
in this lands. Words that once spread like wildfire and now face suppression with a heavy

834
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:43,600
hand and the truth is hidden from sight. Ideas that once flourished in the sun now faced restrictions

835
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:49,520
one by one and free speech is dealt a deadly blow. But we must fight against

836
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,720
this tide and not let censorship divide for the right to express ourselves. We

837
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:59,360
will uphold. Wait, so what's the hypocrisy? That was written by who? You?

838
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:07,520
Chat GPT. No. Yeah. Holy bottom of the page. It says posted by Joe Fedig

839
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:13,580
written by chat GPT. That's fucking insane. Even trust anyone nowadays. Not

840
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:19,900
not even brave minds like Joe Fettig. People say Mr. Joe Fettig, who once

841
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,940
wrote, who once wrote, and let me, let me pull this, this

842
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:25,500
one up. Yeah, I wanna hear this.

843
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,340
Here's a...

844
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:36,460
Mr. Joe Fettig. That's him? The... No fucking way. The once great leader

845
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:42,180
of the MGTOW movement. He looks great. Mr. Joe Fettig, who wrote

846
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,580
false rape. Why protect she lies all the time, dumb bitch charger with the crime

847
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:53,620
is now relying on he is now relying on chat. Gp that man is going his own way

848
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,420

What is there to do in this world, but chive on man this he's a he's a chiving

850
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,220

the chad gbt stuff that does break my heart, because it's like is this is this

852
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:16,080
machine or is it machine and oh my God, that was good post. Yeah, there's

853
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,200

854
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,620
to and he just says thanks. He's taking credit

855
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:29,100
for chat GPT and what fucking universe is that make any God damn it's not right.

856
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:33,500
Oh God, maybe the spider verse and what's the spider verse. I mean the

857
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,240
spider verse that does make sense. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, but also in the

858
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,760
Spider verse you'd all be fucking spiders.

859
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,860
Do I have how much time do I have to do another one? Okay, one last one yeah,

865
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:13,300
Folks, we're going to be closing out the show with a speech by none other than Mr. Dr. Cameron Fetter.

866
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,300
Wow. Thank you.

867
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:19,140
Keep it going for Cameron.

868
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,900
He's putting the coat back on.

869
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,420
He's ready to...

870
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:22,100
It's a speech.

871
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,740
It's a speech. Yeah, you got to be formal, right?

872
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,500
Yeah, button up that...

873
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,620
A little more stately.

874
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:26,980
Let me see. What else can we get?

875
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:28,140
The top button here.

876
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,300
All right, Cameron, let's hear this speech.

877
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,820
I hope the speech is going to move you guys.

878
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,820
I hope that it will too.

879
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,820
Probably going to move my fucking bowels.

880
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:41,820
I'm going to move this.

881
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,820
Yeah, I like that.

882
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:51,820
Games like Minecraft

883
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,820
have shaped our generation

884
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:55,820
with good reason.

885
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,820
Life in middle school

886
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,820
is just like Minecraft.

887
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:01,820
Wow.

888
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,820
We all entered this biome called middle school.

889
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:09,660
middle school, some imagining it was the nether. It was a completely foreign world

890
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:13,540
where we didn't know who we might run into, what we might find that is useful,

891
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:23,620
or how we were going to survive. Each of us was a Steve. Completely indistinguishable

892
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:29,420
from the rest of the kids for at least the first few days. As noobs, we wandered

893
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:36,200
the halls aimlessly until we eventually found a block, then another, and another.

894
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,840
With these blocks, we learned to craft bigger and better things.

895
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,580
We worked hard and grew our world into a place we couldn't wait to enter each day.

896
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:52,180
Some days we ran into more creepers, endermen, and zombies than we would have liked, but

897
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:54,800
we learned to defeat those bad guys.

898
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:59,640
Through friendships and the guidance of our teachers, we became expert craftsmen, building

899
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,640
an amazing world based on cooperative effort.

900
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:09,080
As we learned to adjust our skins, we each found our unique identity, our own unique

901
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,440
identity.

902
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,080
Most of us were even able to mine not just one, but many diamonds along the way.

903
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:20,640
Today we stand together.

904
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:32,280
We stand together.

905
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:39,600
We stand together at the portal to the next dimension, high school.

906
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,220
Let's remember where we are coming from.

907
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:46,720
Let's stand strong in who we are as individuals and as a group.

908
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,920
me and building the next world for ourselves without fear.

909
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,520
And that's the speech everybody.

910
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,020
Thank you.

911
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,220
We'll see you next time.

01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:08,120

When you're, if you smoke weed, it is pretty scary.

920
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:32,860
Oh, a mysterious convict on death row

921
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,740

922

Leonardo DiCaprio. He has to go into your dream DiCaprio.

929
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,100
Why I didn't finish Leo.

Those are the names Leo period Leo period. I think is better. I'm going to
